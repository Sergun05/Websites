There is no reason to contribute to this repository, as its files are generated automatically by a PHP file I programmed.<br>
However, you can contribute with PHP advice in my other repository [here](https://github.com/Stake2/PHP).
Open an issue saying what needs to be improved or fixed, you can open pull requests too, with code changes.
