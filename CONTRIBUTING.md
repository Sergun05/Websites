There is no reason to contribute to this repository, as its files are generated automatically by a PHP script I wrote.<br>
However, you can contribute to my other repo which uses PHP [here](https://github.com/Stake2/stake2-php), and give advice, open issues saying what I can do better, and open pull requests too.
