This website and the story in it is connected to the New World Universe, if you want to know more about New World,
<a href="https://diario.netlify.com/new_world/" class="w3-blue">[Click here]</a><br />
It will talk about a story I created, called Clone Network,<br />
Is basically my Old World life(see "Old World" in the Names Section of the New World Website),<br />
But with clones added, I can make clones of myself, to work, to study, all at the same time,<br />
I've been suffering from those things in life recently,<br />
But I want to write this story, even if it is a refuge for me, to think that I am that way right now, that I can do everything at the same time.</h5><hr class="bluebar" />

Chapter 1<br />
<br />
Hey, I'm Izaque Sanvezzo, and I'm writing this story, called Clone Network, it's the first chapter, you know.<br />
Please read the New World documentation on the website to understand a little about this story or the technology that I talk about here.<br />
It's a beautiful day at the life of Izaque, the Old World Izaque, living in 2019, without New World technology.<br />
He goes to school, have fun at the computer, helps his parents with their work, and tries to make his parents happy.<br />
But he's a little sad because it's hard to go to school and have a lot of stuff to do on the computer.<br />
There are so many things he wants to do, but he doesn't have time.<br />
At a specific day, he's in the computer, playing a game, and a type of flash appears close to him.<br />
He doesn't notice it, the flash disappears and he feels a little tired.<br />
Izaque sleeps and wakes up, he discovers that he received a New World technology, capable of making clones of himself.<br />
He understands and learns about that technology, a New World Izaque sent him that system.<br />
Izaque tries to use it in his room, he creates a clone called "Worker #2", which is the first clone.<br />
The Worker clone only has the will to work and to make money, Izaque shows his parents that he made a clone.<br />
The parents of Izaque get surprised, Worker #2 tries to work at some place in the city, to bring money home.<br />
He works for a month and receives money, Izaque gets really happy because of that.<br />
Now Izaque helps with the bills of the house, his parents get really happy about that.<br />
Izaque thinks that he's slow at school, he creates a clone to learn Brazilian Portuguese, called "PortuguÃªs #3", and one for PE called "EducaÃ§Ã£o FÃ­sica #4".<br />
The people at school get surprised when they see two Izaques, but after some time they get used to it.<br />
The clones and Izaque #1 also received an Equestrian Magic technology or system, which gives them the ability to use Equestrian magic.<br />
They can lift things with the power of their minds and telekinesis, PortuguÃªs #3 and EducaÃ§Ã£o FÃ­sica #4 can write without touching the pen or pencil.<br />
Izaque #1 thinks he's sleeping bad, he creates a clone called "Sleeper #5", the clone sleeps all day and just wants to sleep.<br />
All the clones and Izaque #1 have the same hunger, thirst and sleep needs, but only Izaque #1 eats.<br />
After helping with the bills of the house of his parents, Izaque #1 wants to save some money on a bank account.<br />
Worker #2 gets a promotion, he creates a bank account and starts saving money, Izaque #1 wants to buy all of the houses he lived when he was a kid.<br />
After saving some money he buys the house and starts saving money again, Izaque decides he needs more money and creates a "Worker 2 #6".<br />
Worker #2 works on a pizzeria, Worker 2 #6 works on a fast food restaurant, Izaque uses Worker #2 and Worker 2 #6 to save money on the bank and buy his childhood houses.<br />
Then he decides he wants better things, a better computer, he wants to fill the house of his parents with food.<br />
He creates a clone called "Worker 3 #7", after working on a good job, Worker 3 buys a new computer for Izaque.<br />
Izaque thanks him, it was a computer with 32GB RAM, a 10TB Hard drive, a 4.00GHz processor, and a good graphics card.<br />
After some time, Izaque is happy with his life, the life of Izaque #1 is using the computer, writing stories, playing games, managing the clones, eating.<br />
Izaque decides his clones need a smartphone, so they can communicate with each other.<br />
Worker 1, 2 and 3 saves money to buy 20 equal smartphones and 20 mobile chips of a network called "Oi".<br />
Izaque #1, Worker #2, PortuguÃªs #3, EducaÃ§Ã£o FÃ­sica #4, Sleeper #5, Worker 2 #6, and Worker 3 #7 gets a smartphone.<br />
The three worker clones buy a car for them, Worker 3 #7 takes PortuguÃªs and EducaÃ§Ã£o FÃ­sica to school and brings them back home when they need.<br />
Worker 3 #7 fills the house of the parents of Izaque #1 with one year worth of food.<br />
Izaque #1 decides he wants to finish school quick, he creates a clone called "PortuguÃªs 2 #8", one called "InglÃªs #9", another clone "InglÃªs 2 #10", and another called "Artes #11".<br />
And creates another one called "Escritor #12" and gives him a smartphone to write his stories when he can't.<br />
So the list goes like this: "Izaque #1, Worker #2, PortuguÃªs #3, EducaÃ§Ã£o FÃ­sica #4, Sleeper #5, Worker 2 #6, Worker 3 #7, PortuguÃªs 2 #8, InglÃªs #9, InglÃªs 2 #10, Artes #11, Escritor #12".<br />
Izaque is happy with his life, he finished buying all of his childhood houses and haves R$200.000 stored in the bank.<br />
He finished paying the cars and houses he was buying, and always pay the bills of the house of his parents every month, his parents don't need to work anymore.<br />
Some times when his family needs, Worker 3 #7 gives a little money, to his sister, Gabi, his other sister, Aline, or his brother, Cristiano.<br />
The routine of Izaque #1 is like this, he wakes up at 06:00 am, eats breakfast, turns on his computer and start writing one chapter of one of his stories.<br />
Then he plays some games for some time, he also knows PHP and has a lot of sites to make and to upload, he loves programming and making sites.<br />
Izaque #1 also has a 1TB Music Library on his computer and smartphone, he spends his entire day on the computer, and taking breaks to eat.<br />
He wanted to live like this, doing his productive stuff at the computer, writing stories, making websites, playing games, talking to his friends on Discord.<br />
Izaque #1 thinks he's blessed to receive a technology like that from a New World universe or planet.<br />
Worker #2 and Worker 2 #6 don't visit the house of the parents of Izaque too much, they just deposit the money at the bank account and continue working.<br />
That was the life that Izaque dreamed of, being able to do a lot of stuff at the same time, and being productive.<br />
At a specific day, Sleeper was awakened by the parents of Izaque #1, and all the Izaques were sleepy all day, PortuguÃªs 1 and 2 couldn't focus on the class.<br />
Worker 1, 2 and 3 couldn't focus on the job, Izaque #1 made a voice call with all the Izaques at the same time, telling that his parents woke up Sleeper and he can't sleep anymore.<br />
Izaque said he's trying to fix that, to get him to sleep again, that day was fun, Izaque #1 could get Sleeper to sleep again, and everything went back to normal.<br />
There's also a subsystem Izaque, called the Izaque #0, the one who says which clones use which systems.<br />
Only Izaque #1 can use the Clones System, any clone can use the Equestrian Magic System, Teleportation System and the Headphone connected to the Universal Music Library.<br />
On Sundays and Saturdays Worker 3 #7 takes PortuguÃªs #3, EducaÃ§Ã£o FÃ­sica #4, PortuguÃªs 2 #8, InglÃªs #9, InglÃªs 2 #10 and Artes #11 to a hangout.<br />
Izaque #1 owns 5 houses, he's planning on buying another one and populate all the houses with clones named "Morador".<br />
Izaque #1 is pretty expressive and proud about his clones, one day a friend of PortuguÃªs #3 asked him how he can create clones.<br />
He replied saying that Izaque #1 received a "blessing", that he received a technology from the future, which can create clones.<br />
PortuguÃªs #3 is proud of being an Izaque clone, he studies and writes in his notebook using Equestrian Magic, the aura of his telekinetic field is orange.<br />
He can talk with his friends at school because he doesn't need to look at his notebook to write, he can feel the letters with his telekinetic field.<br />
Worker 3 #7 loved to help his parents, his family and to help the other clones, he's a really kind guy.<br />
Escritor #12 also helps Izaque #1 when he needs, with games, stories, and websites, also for eating, he prepares food for Izaque #1 when he's busy.<br />
Izaque #1 is planning on buying another computer, for Escritor to write stories better, and for other clones to use the computer too.<br />
To reply to Discord messages quicker, to play games, to download things faster and better.<br />
The life of Izaque changed drastically since the gift he received, and he loves his life right now, he has time to do a lot of stuff.<br />
He wants to expand, to reproduce this Izaque race, fill the world with Izaques, he wants to have 20 clones working on stories.<br />
20 replying social media messages, 20 working on jobs to earn money, 20 playing games, 20 downloading stuff, 25 to manage the money.<br />
30 making websites, 25 buying stuff, 10 for eating, drinking, sleeping, taking baths, 30 for visiting his friends.<br />
Izaque #1 wants to be proud of calling this network the Clone Network, teams of Izaques to do a lot of stuff.<br />
First, he needs to populate the 5 empty houses he owns, he owns 6, but he lives on one, all of his current 12 clones are deactivated when they are not in use.<br />
When Escritor finishes 3 chapters of 3 different stories he's deactivated, when all the 6 clones who go to school are done with going to school on that day, they are deactivated.<br />
Izaque #1 is pretty happy with the life he has now.<br />
