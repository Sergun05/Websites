<h5 style="color:#99d9ea;">Government: "A Government that takes care of all beings, and tries to protect and help beings of other galaxies and planets, it was created in the Planet Earth in the Milky Way galaxy by Humans(Homo Sapiens), it has a System called Basic Pack or Neural Network."<br />
<br />
Old World(World): "It's how the beings in the Government call the Planet Earth(Milky Way Galaxy) when the Government didn't existed."<br />
Old World(Beings): "It's how the beings in the Government call the beings that aren't from the Government and doesn't use the System(Basic Pack and Neural Network)."<br />
<br />
New World(World): "It's how the beings in the Government call the Planet Earth(Milky Way Galaxy) when the Government started."<br />
New World(Beings): "It's how the beings in the Government call the beings that are from the Government and use the System(Basic Pack and Neural Network)."</h5>

<h4 style="color:#99d9ea;"><a name="ig"></a>| Subscription For Government |</h4>
<h5 style="color:#99d9ea;">To enter the Governmet you need to be a being, you will receive a lot of things after you enter.<br />
<br />
You will receive a:<br />
Neural-Network: "Neural Network is a way to create holograms and interfaces with your brain, it comes with the Basic Pack(BP) 1.0 and 2.0, you can use your brain to do a lot of things, such as navigate the Internet using your retina, see your UIH(Universal Identification Hologram), and change and create files in the file explorer."<br />
<br />
And a:<br />
Basic Pack: "The Basic Pack is a neural pack that you get when you join the Government(General Government of Beings), it gives you the ability to make holograms, retina interfaces, and to modify the world around you, the pack is basic, and other users of the Government create personal packs, some come with weapons, installed games, pack of songs, alternative hologram colors."<br />
<br />
And also a:<br />
Universal Identification Hologram(UIH): "UIH is a hologram that contains the Uid, it can be visualized using a hand hologram or a retina interface." <br />
Universal Identification(Uid): "Uid is a way to give every sapient being a unique identification."<br />
<br />
You will also receive the chance to evolve to a neural being, if you are a Human(Homo Sapiens) you will retain your physical form but will be a neural being, a being made of neural energy, like a soul, so if your native body has needs, your evolution form or neural form won't have them, like hunger, need for oxygen, for blood or water. <br />
<br />
There are some Universal Laws that you will be into after you join the Government:<br />
<br />
You cannot modify a being without the consent of it(like cutting, burning, freezing, teleporting it).<br />
You cannot steal something from a being(like an item, an object).<br />
You cannot break physical structures and items that don't belong to you(like a house or a sword).<br />
Basically you cannot modify things of other beings or the beings without permission of them.<br />
You can kill a being if you two are in a duel or fight on a simulated environment(like a game or a neural environment).</h5>

<h5 style="color:#99d9ea;">This is the documentation of the Universal Identification Hologram(UIH):<br />
<br />
Uid Format: [name] [surname] ([race][race_sex][age_in_planet_years][born_year_in_planet_years]), Example: "Izaque Sanvezzo(hm172002)"<br />
<br />
Universal Identification(Uid): "Uid is a way to give every sapient being a unique identification"<br />
<br />
Format Expansion:<br />
[name]: A word or a combination of words by which a being, place, or thing, a body or class, or any object of thought is designated, called, or known.<br />
<br />
[surname]: A hereditary name common to all members of a family, as distinct from a given name.<br />
<br />
[race]: An arbitrary classification of beings, sometimes, especially formerly, based on any or a combination of various physical characteristics, as skin color, facial form, or eye shape, and now frequently based on such genetic markers as blood groups.<br />
<br />
[race_sex]: Either of the two main categories (male and female) into which beings are divided on the basis of their reproductive functions.<br />
<br />
[age_in_planet_years]: A period of being life, measured by years from birth, usually marked by a certain stage or degree of mental or physical development and involving legal responsibility and capacity, some age numbers can be different from planet to planet, example: 79 years old in the planet Earth in the Milky Way galaxy is equal to 39 years old for the planet mars on the Milky Way galaxy.<br />
<br />
[born_year_in_planet_years]: The year a being was born in the age number of the planet it was born.<br />
</h5><br />
<h4 style="color:#99d9ea;"><a name="pid"></a>| Planet Identification |</h4>
<h5 style="color:#99d9ea;">
[planet_name]: A word or a combination of words by which a planet is designated, called, or known.<br />
<br />
[planet_galaxy]: A physical space which a planet reside.<br />
<br />
[planet_population_number]: The number of beings in a planet's area.<br />
<br />
[planet_current_year]: The current year in the calendar numbers of that planet, example: When the "Homo sapiens" species landed on their Moon the current year in the planet Earth in the Milky Way galaxy was 1969.</h5><hr style="background-color:#99d9ea;height:2px;border:0;" />
