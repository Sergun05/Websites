This is the explanation of this text project, made by me, Izaque Sanvezzo(hm162002), I'm using this identification explained in the project "UIH"(Universal Identification Hologram), and I'm here to explain this project, this text file is being wrote in 13/06/2018 in human(homo sapiens) years, this project "Future" is to teach and explain and show the future, what the Earth could be, what technology we will have, and is to show the future of the world, the Old World Style future, I'm writing this project and this text file with the help of the songs of a game called Plague Inc., the name of the playlist is "Plague Inc: Original Soundtrack", a soundtrack that makes you feel the doom of the earth, a bad future, it's a game about throwing a disease in the earth, but for me the music sounds like a good future, a hopeful future, so I'll write this project with these feelings.
