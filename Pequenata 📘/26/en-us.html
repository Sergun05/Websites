Littletato was a potato that lived alone, she was always tripping and walking through cities, <br />
and loved to live and to see new things, one day she found another potato, and then they talked a lot, <br />
they started to know each other a little more, the other potato was called Julia and was of pink color, <br />
they planned a whole life... they planned what city they would go, what house and a lot of other things, <br />
and they traveled to that city that they dreamed of, the city was San Francisco, they bought a house and lived there, <br />
once in a while Littletato came out to the shop to buy things, but she didn't bought tatos(potatoes) because that was cannibalism and she thought that this thing that humans made is bad, <br />
to put living things there, San Francisco was a city where vegetables and fruits could live safe without humans close, <br />
but still vegetables and fruits were sold, other people bought fruits and vegetables to eat, but Littletato thought that that was gross, <br />
she only bought meat and milk, and some grains like rice and beans, then Littletato found a friend of her while walking home, <br />
the friend was a sweet potato called Yam, Yam was of masculine sex, Yam and Littletato talked a lot, <br />
Yam said that in Las Vegas they sold meat and vegetables even if there were Cows in there and they continued to talk, <br />
then Littletato finished the conversation and started walking to home again...<br />

<br /><br /><br /><br />
Then Littletato came back to her home, and talked to Julia about the conversation she had with Yam, <br />
then she placed the food she bought from shop in the table, she helped Julia prepare the dinner, <br />
they made the dinner and ate it, then slept, in the other day Littletato woke up but Julia didn't wake up, <br />
Littletato got out of bed and started to make breakfast and drank milk with chocolate and ate some breads with butter, <br />
then she came to the room where her and Julia slept, she thought that Julia was so cute sleeping that she didn't woke up her, <br />
Littletato had a computer in her house, it was in the living room and was where she had all the information about the world, <br />
she then came to the computer and turned it on, she logged in her Vegebook account and she saw all her friends, <br />
even if this friends were just on the internet, she thought that was awesome to have friends, then she became to roll on the page, <br />
her friends always posted some news, and one news interested her, it was a news about how New York citizens were trying to fight the fruits and wanting freedom, <br />
the news said that fruits was invading New York and the vegetables didn't liked that, Littletato thought that San Francisco was good because of that, <br />
the city of San Francisco was stabilized, no fight between the citizens, and then Littletato closed the page and came back to rolling her Vegebook timeline, <br />
then Yam, her old friend called her on the chat, he said that in New York they had good jobs, <br />
but then Littletato answered that she already had a home in San Francisco and didn't need to work, then Yam asked how, <br />
then she replied that she had a girlfriend in San Francisco, and then Yam said that he forgot that and said that he had to do somethings, <br />
Littletato replied the same, they finished the conversation and Littletato signed out of her Vegebook account, <br />
and came out of the house to relax a little, then came back again and closed the door, <br />
Julia called her and Littletato came to her room to see what Julia was needing, Julia said that was nothing with a smile of her face, <br />
then said that she loved Littletato, Littletato said the same, then Littletato came back to bed to sleep a bit more, <br />
she looked on clock and was six am, then Littletato hugged Julia by her back and they slept together...<br />

<br /><br /><br /><br />
Then the clock ringed, Littletato woke up and saw the hours, it was eleven in the morning, <br />
she got out of bed to make coffee, and made coffee, she poured coffee in her squared mug, <br />
and poured in other mug at the other side of the table to Julia, and she placed butter in her bread and in Julia's, <br />
then she came to her bed to wake up Julia, Littletato gave a kiss in the cheek of Julia and said wake up to her, <br />
Julia slowly opened her eyes and looked at Littletato with a smile on her face, then Julia hugged Littletato, <br />
Littetato smiled and called Julia to eat breakfast, they came to the kitchen and ate while talking about somethings, <br />
then Julia said that she was going to call her sister to visit her house, and Littletato said she wish to met Julia's sister, <br />
then Julia smiled, Littletato said that she was going to work, Julia smiled and said ok, Littletato carried up the things she needed for the job, <br />
and said goodbye to Julia then got out the house and started walking to her job, then she arrived at work, and then started to work, <br />
it was a technology company that made smartphones and apps for smartphones, Littletato before leaving the house said that she would arrive home at six, <br />
Julia then said that her sister would arrive at six and a half, while Littletato was working Julia was preparing the house to her sister visit, <br />
her sister was called Patricia, she had nineteen years old and Julia had eighteen, time passed, Littletato was walking back to home, <br />
then she noticed some televisions on a shop window, she heard that a war was happening in Las Vegas, <br />
and that vegetables were fighting against some animals, Littletato by seeing that became a little sad, <br />

It was a Saturday, Littletato was dreaming, dreaming of a new world, she was dreaming of something that she never saw, <br />
some neon, she was driving a car through a road, on the side of the road was some purple and blue neon lights, <br />

Julia was still sleeping, Littletato came to the bathroom to make the daily necessities, <br />
and then she came to the kitchen to make some coffee and breads with butter, Julia was dreaming of some cupcakes, <br />
and a castle, an old castle with old architecture, she was a queen drinking some tea on a big table, and eating cupcakes, <br />
she saw those pink cupcakes and thought of Pinkie Pie, a character from a cartoon she liked, she knew that Pinkie Pie liked cupcakes too, <br />
and she was eating some chocolate cake too, then she woke up, she looked to the ceiling while thinking of all that food, her stomach rumbled, <br />
she then felt the smell of coffee and milk, she got out of bed, made the daily necessities then came to the kitchen to eat breakfast, <br />
she sat with Littletato, she said about her dream, Littletato shared hers too, <br />
they ate the breakfast and came to the living room to watch some movies in the Vegeflix app on the Smart TV, <br />
Littletato has heard that there is a new movie called "The Vegengers: Infinite Vegetablewar", she wanted to watch that with Julia, <br />

the heroes, and then Patricia sent a message through Vegebook in the cell phone of Julia, Julia picked up the phone to answer, <br />
Patricia said that she was having fun with her boyfriend in New York, and that she was happy there, <br />
Julia sent some happy face emojis to Patricia and said that that was good, and she was happy for her, <br />
Patricia said thanks to Julia, Littletato asked who was and Julia said that was her sister, <br />
then Littletato picked up her phone, she sent a message through Vegesapp to her sister, <br />

It was a Wednesday, Littletato was sat in her computer, listening to some Dubstep in the Vegecloud website, <br />
she liked and followed some Dubstep artists, she was listening to the "Fucking Noise" song of the artist "Stratus", <br />
she liked that song, Littletato was doing that while she talked with her friends on Vegecord, an app that <br />
she had on her computer, the app was made for gamers that wanted to share what they were gaming, <br />
she was in a Vegecord server of the site SuperAnimes, that was the site where she watched anime, <br />
she wanted to know about the news of the site, Littletato liked to write stories too, <br />
she loved to write one specific story of hers, called "Kezzakam", she posted that story in the Veggepad, <br />

after sometime she closed Vegecloud, she downloaded some songs, Littletato also liked to draw, she wasn't very good, <br />
but she had fun, she posted her drawings at Vegiantart, she received a lot of favorites and comments, Littletato also used Vegewitter, <br />
she liked to post there but there wasn't much people to read her Vegeweets, but she liked to read other people's Vegeweets, <br />
then she turned her computer off and got up to make another thing.<br />
<br />
Author's note(Isaac notes): Today was the first day writing Littletato without listening to Indie Folk songs, that was cool, <br />
I wrote while listening to some Dubstep on Vegecloud, was good.<br />

she picked up her laptop and placed it on the table, and turned it on, <br />
she opened Vegeteam and Vegefox, just preparing to do a lot of things...<br />

It was a Friday, Littletato decided to save some money to buy a car, she worked, <br />
then came back to her house, she opened her laptop to find a good car, <br />
she found a cheap one, the seller was named Igor, there was places in San Francisco that you could rent bikes, <br />
Littletato had some money in her bank account, she decided to rent a bike to go to the agreed place, <br />
she arrived there, and gave the money to Igor, it was a red car, Littletato thought that the car was beautiful and shiny, <br />
they talked a little, they sent friend requests to each other, Littletato asked if Igor could return the bike to the bike rent place, <br />
he said yes, then Littletato drove her car back to her house, then told to Julia that she bought a car, <br />
Julia was so happy about that, but she asked why Littletato bought a car, Littletato said that she wanted to go for a trip, <br />
Julia was happy to hear that, Littletato then parked the car on the lot, she turned it off and locked it, <br />
Littletato came inside her house, she was a little hungry, Julia had already made the dinner, <br />
Littletato and Julia ate together, the food was delicious, then Littletato used her laptop to talk a little with Igor before going to sleep, <br />
the night was a little cold, Littletato got a warm blanket to sleep with Julia, they hugged and snuggled, <br />
Littletato woke up and made the breakfast, she woke up Julia to eat the breakfast with her, they ate together, <br />
Littletato said to Julia that she was planning a trip to Texas, she knew that there was some Chocolate Bars living there, <br />
she wanted to give Texas a visit, to see how it was, she planned with Julia to go there in the next Saturday...<br />

It was a Saturday, Littletato was preparing herself to Travel to Texas, <br />
she filled up the tank of her red car and grabbed some food and money to use on the trip, <br />
they brought their laptops to the trip, they had a wireless internet connection, <br />
Littletato turned on the GPS and set it to go to Texas, <br />
started the engine and started driving to where the GPS told her, <br />
after some minutes they arrived at the entrance of Texas, <br />
Littletato drove to the center of the city, both of them noticed that the city had a chocolate bars population, <br />
there were black chocolate, white, some different ones like a black diamond one, KitKat too, <br />
milk chocolate, it was an interesting city, they liked to be in there, <br />
they stopped by a shop to talk with some people, there was a white chocolate person named Layla, <br />
she asked if Littletato was not from there, Littletato replied positively, <br />
Layla said that there are some few people that are vegetables there, <br />
but the city is mainly composed of chocolates, then Layla said for them to look around the city, <br />
if they think is good, they can move to Texas, Littletato met a lot of new people there, <br />
she liked the city, then Julia and Littletato stopped by a park to eat a little, <br />
they ate some bread with butter and coca-cola, while they looked at the beautiful nature, <br />
Julia said that place was beautiful, after eating Littletato and Julia came back to the car and started driving to the city again, <br />
they liked Texas, Littletato suggested for them to live there, <br />
Julia said she was used to San Francisco, Littletato put to play some dubstep music on the sound system of the car, <br />
it was playing "Love Is Tension" by "IFeature", it was fun to drive through the city with a dubstep song playing, <br />
Littletato loved to hear songs while driving, she loves that since she traveled with her father, <br />
when she was child, Littletato was happy there, driving through the city, the wind passing through her hair, <br />
she liked the songs of IFeature, Julia liked them too, she turned on her laptop and posted on Vegewitter, <br />
Vegebook saying that she was in Texas, some people liked the Vegeweet and the post on Vegebook, <br />
Julia was happy about that, Patricia also liked and commented on the post on Vegebook, <br />
she said she was happy for Julia, and wished a lot of happiness in her life, <br />
Julia became so happy about that, she smiled to Littletato, Littletato smiled back, <br />
they were so happy at that moment, seeing the city, an emotional song was playing, "Energy" by "IFeature", <br />
the song provided the exact feeling they were feeling at that moment, <br />
Julia placed her hand on top of the hand of Littletato, Julia was thinking about My Little Pony, <br />
how she loved that world, how that world made her happy, and how much she was happy at that moment, <br />
just like the happiness that My Little Pony brought to her, she was inspired, she was happy, <br />
she was super good, feeling super well, she loved that moment, she wanted that moment to last forever, <br />
a lot of things was running through her mind, she stopped thinking a little, and just enjoyed the moment, <br />
they calmed themselves a little, Littletato said it was time to go home...<br />

Littletato was alone in her room, she had 11 on that day and was playing some Vegecraft while listening to Xenogenesis of TheFatRat, <br />
she loved to listen to that song while playing, she used an app to download the song from Vegetube, <br />
she was playing with a friend, Julia, her parents were working, so she stayed at home to take care of the chores, <br />
she knew how to make her own food, suddenly she felt hungry, then she minimized the game and let her character stationary, <br />
she put to play some Panic At The Disco in her computer while she made coffee, <br />
she prepared the coffee and poured it on a cup with milk and made some breads with butter, <br />
then she came back to her computer and paused the song that was playing, <br />
then she said to Julia that she was going to eat something while watching an anime, <br />
Julia said she was going to stay there, farming the farms, Littletato changed to her video player and dropped the "Eromanga Sensei EP1" file on it, <br />
she started watching it while tasting her food and drink, after a while she finished watching it, she liked, <br />
then Littletato felt a little tired, she waited for her parents to come home, <br />
then said to Julia that she was going to sleep, her parents arrived at home, <br />
so Littletato turned off her computer and walked to her room and layed on her bed, she slept...<br />
<br />
It was a beautiful day, birds were singing, nature was flourishing, Littletato had 22 that day, <br />
she was riding her bike through the city, while listening to some folk music on her mobile phone, <br />
the sight of a good day on the city, cars passing by, the sun shining high on the sky, she loved to do that, <br />
to ride through the city, she also liked to look at the sky, the beautiful blue tone, with the cottons that were the clouds, <br />
she had a high roof on her house, so she could look at the stars at night and the clouds at day, <br />
whenever she wanted, she loved to do that while listening to her favorite songs, <br />
the images on Vegetify, of trees, nature, folk songs, singer-songwriter songs, <br />
those were her favorite songs, and her favorite moments, it was a thing that Littletato really loved to do, <br />
to see the nature, to contemplate nature, to be passive, to just... look at things, she loved her bicycle, <br />
it was an awesome style of life...<br />

Littletato and Julia were in their car, Littletato filled up the tank again to have enough fuel to travel back home, <br />
started the engine of the car and drove back to the shop where Layla was and asked for her Vegebook, <br />
Layla added Julia and Littletato on Vegebook and said goodbye to them, Littletato started driving back to San Francisco, <br />
on the way back home, Julia thought about how the trip was to her, what she saw, whom she met there, <br />
the songs she heard, she thought about coming home and writing a big text file telling how the trip was for her, <br />
what she felt, Littletato was a little tired and wanted to sleep, she liked to test her new car on the trip, <br />
and she was getting used to that beautiful red car, she wanted to listen to some music, <br />
she selected the song "Tisoki - New Wave" on her Vegetify app, Julia and Littletato liked the song, <br />
they both banged their heads to the songs, Julia was surprised because of the drop, <br />
it said "the fuck Tisoki", after some time, Littletato wanted to listen to something more chill, <br />
she put to play an Indie Folk playlist on Vegetify, they both loved the songs, it was a little late, <br />
Littletato looked on the digital clock of the car and saw it was 10:00 pm, <br />
they were arriving close to the entrance of San Francisco, Littletato entered the city and drove back to her house, <br />
she parked her car on the front of her house, locked it and came inside the house, <br />
Julia and Littletato were tired, Julia prepared the dinner and they both ate together and prepared to sleep, <br />
Julia wrote about the trip, what she felt, she posted the text she made on Vegebook, <br />
some friends of Julia liked the post, she was happy about that, <br />
Julia turned off her laptop and walked to her room, <br />
Littletato and Julia layed on the bed and tried to sleep, <br />
Littletato said: "What if we had a dog or a cat?...", <br />
Julia replied: "I think that is a good idea, honey...", <br />
then Littletato said: "I love you, my sweetie", <br />
Julia replied: "I love you too honey", they closed their eyes and slept, <br />
Littletato dreamed about living in a mansion, she was sat in a throne, <br />
a maid brought her a dog with a yellow fur, she loved it, and wanted to stay with it, <br />
the dog was female, she grabbed it and left her on her lap, she liked that dream, <br />
she wanted to have a dog just like that one...<br />

Littletato was dreaming of golds, she loved the gold color and the visual of it, there were gold balls, <br />
gold ores, gold ingots, everything gold, it was a weird dream, but a good dream.<br />
<br />
After some time, the dream changed to something else, there were pink fur balls and a lot of fur things, <br />
she liked the sensation of it, there was coffee too, a beautiful land, of coffee and fur, and brown things, <br />
that land was beautiful, there were big brown mushrooms like tall trees, and the wind and air there were amazing, <br />
you could feel like you were floating in the beautiful, calm and quiet sky, like lying down on cotton candy, or in a cloud, <br />
feel the grass touching your skin, feeling the sweet cool breeze touch your body, it was a beautiful sight, <br />
it was amazing to be there, Littletato wished she lived there forever, there were also chocolates, <br />
big chocolate bars, as high as a skyscraper, there was tons of food, everyone could eat, it was an incredible land, <br />
the scent of the delightful and luscious chocolate bars and the mouthwatering and appetizing aroma of the warm lakes of coffee with milk, <br />
a lot of people like to bathe and drink in it and it would not get dirty, because it was some type of magical liquid, <br />
Littletato loved to live in a giant world like that, chocolate bars fell from the sky unexpectedly, <br />
producing huge quakes and bumps on the surface, the food was infinite, there was also candies that were not chocolate, like jujubes, <br />
bubble gums, quebra-queixos, big chocolate cakes that fell from the sky, delicious and warm applepies, <br />
black chocolate brownies, cheesecakes, a lot of sweet and sugary food, at one time, <br />
Littletato was laying on the gentle grass, listening to some Future Bass, some cute and calm songs on her smartphone, <br />
she were contemplative and meditative, look at that beautiful land, <br />
it made her feel so wondrus and spectacular, so calm and happy, she wanted to stay there forever...<br />

﻿<b>Title: The Dog</b><br /><br />
Littletato was walking home, she was thinking about that yellow dog from that dream she had, she passed near a pet shop, <br />
there were some dogs waiting to be adopted, and there was this specific dog, its fur was yellow, <br />
just like that one in Littletato's dream, she loved it, then Littletato entered the pet shop and asked if she could take it, <br />
then she filled the paperwork and adopted the dog.<br />
<br />
Littletato sent a text message to Julia saying "The dog is coming 🙂".<br />
<br />
Julia replied saying: "Oh, I'm so excited! 😊"<br />
<br />
Then Littletato started walking back home, with the dog on her torso, she loved it, and the dog loved her, <br />
it was female, she called her Lisa, she was so fluffy and cute, she licked Littletato's face.<br />
<br />
Littletato arrived home and showed the dog to Julia, she loved the dog and hugged her, Lisa licked the cheek of Julia, <br />
they prepared a place for Lisa to sleep and brought food to her, and made a place for Lisa to do her necessities, <br />
Julia prepared some coffee with milk and loaves of bread with butter for Littletato, they ate together, <br />
both were so happy having Lisa to cheer them up, she ran around the house, wanting to explore everything, <br />
the place was so new to her, Littletato thought it was a good idea to adopt a dog, she was so happy at that moment, she hugged Julia and smiled, Julia smiled back.<br />
<br />
After some time, Littletato and Julia were tired, they wanted to sleep, <br />
Littletato locked the house and prepared herself to sleep, <br />
the couple laid in bed and tried to sleep, Littletato dreamed about having a lot of great and happy moments with Julia and Lisa, <br />
taking her to the park, hugging her, taking care of her, she loved that dream, because it was real...<br />
<br />
(Then the ending of the "No ekisaitinguna seikatsu Littletato [Littletatoのエキサイティングな生活]" (The exciting life of Littletato) anime plays, <br />
Stake2's notes: well, it was really cool to write this chapter, I changed the title, <br />
I actually inserted a title instead of doing just "chapter 1" and 2 and 3, <br />
this way I can remember easily what happened in the chapter instead of saying just "the dreamland chapter" or "the Texas trip chapter", <br />
I wrote this piece listening to SubCarbon Records Soundcloud profile, and... I just wanted to say that to you guys :3, <br />
also, this is how I imagine Littletato (ignore the dogs) <a href="https://static.zerochan.net/Shouin.600.1344153.jpg" class="w3-text-white">https://static.zerochan.net/Shouin.600.1344153.jpg</a>, a really shy girl xD)<br />

<b>Title: PequeLiving, SpaceNata?</b><br /><br />
Littletato was scrolling in her Vegebook timeline at her computer until something weird happened, <br />
she began floating and a light blue light surrounded her body.<br />
<br />
Then after some time, she woke up in a beautiful and clean white bed, with a white bed sheet, she looked around and there was no one, <br />
just white walls, the bed she was laying in, and a computer screen on a table, after looking a bit more, <br />
she realized that she was inside a SpaceShip, there was a huge, blue word on a wall of the spaceship, "LonelyShip" was the word, <br />
she sat at the chair close to the computer table and turned on the computer, she thought to herself: "Where am I?, in some kind of spaceship or sci-fi movie?".<br />
<br />
The computer turns on and a screen message appears saying:<br />
<i>"Hello, it looks like you are inside a SpaceShip, called the LonelyShip, created by the company ThinkOutsideTheBox or TOTB, <br />
you were randomly chosen to live inside here because you have the requisites to live here, this is a supercomputer, <br />
which is super fast and has a lot of hard drive space, you can use the Automatic Fridge called ThoughtPoweredFridge(TPF) to eat...".<br />
<br />
"By the fact that you have been randomly chosen, you can choose to go back to your normal life by right-clicking the SpaceLiving tray icon in your computer, <br />
click on it and click on [Teleport back to Earth], read the wiki of SpaceLiving or use the Discord invite link to get on the TOTB's Discord server if you need more help, <br />
as always, defend yourself from the asteroids, stay safe, take care, and be lonely!".</i><br />
<br />
Littletato was afraid of that, she did not want to leave Julia there, maybe Julia would worry about Littletato's absence, <br />
maybe she would be very sad about it and would continue looking for Littletato, Littletato did not want this to happen, <br />
she would be sad, but also, she wanted to explore this New World, this spaceship, she wanted to look behind the windows.<br />
<br />
She opened MoTable Vegefox which was already installed on her computer and searched for the Wikipedia of SpaceLiving and for the invite link to the TOTB's Discord server, <br />
after some time reading, she understood a lot about that world.<br />
<br />
Littletato was hungry, she got up and opened the fridge and was surprised because the exact food she wanted to eat was there, <br />
a big slice of pepperoni pizza which cheese, the smell was so good, the slice was warm, she wanted so much to eat that pizza, <br />
she picked up the plate and laid it on the table, she wanted to watch something while eating, <br />
she downloaded an episode of Eromanga Sensei to watch, she was in the middle of that anime.<br />
<br />
After eating and watching, Littletato installed the Discord app on her computer and joined the TOTB server, <br />
she met a lot of cool people there, there was Izaque, Wendy, Drag, Kendra, Manuh, Ted, Monika, John, <br />
and there was a special person there, and that person was called Lisa, the same name of her dog, <br />
Littletato was a little sad about thinking about her dog, Lisa, the person at the Discord server, <br />
was really cute and gentle, Littletato liked her, she wanted to talk more with her, Littletato took some courage and added her as a friend on Discord.<br />

<b>Title: Return and discovery</b><br /><br />
After her trip to a SpaceLiving spaceship, Littletato arrived home safely, it was morning, <br />
Julia was worried, she asked where Littletato was, Littletato explained everything to her and told her to not be worried, <br />
then Julia brew some coffee for Littletato, they ate together, they also gave food to Lisa, <br />
Littletato looked at her dog and thought about Lisa, her friend from SpaceLiving, <br />
she had a lot of good times with her and Izaque, she was very happy there, <br />
Littletato wished to make another trip to a SpaceLiving spaceship, she told Julia about the trip she made, <br />
Julia said she wanted to make a trip to a spaceship just like that, and thought it would be awesome.<br />
<br />
Littletato then installed Vegecord on her laptop so she can talk with Lisa, Izaque and other friends from SpaceLiving, <br />
unfortunately, her old account wasn't there, she didn't have her friends, <br />
Littletato thought that her account only existed in the SpaceLiving world, <br />
and she couldn't access it if she wasn't on a spaceship, then she created another account on Vegecord, <br />
she joined some servers, Littletato thought about Izaque, she wanted to talk to him again, <br />
she tried to remind something about him, some profile on the internet she could talk to him, <br />
she remembered about a story Izaque sent to her, Clone Network, she typed the website URL and opened the page, <br />
after analyzing and searching a little she found out that Izaque used stake2 on the internet as a nickname, <br />
she searched on VegeWattpad for an author called stake2 and she found his profile, <br />
she started reading a weird story called "Life of Littletato", it looked like her name written there, she thought to herself:<br />
"It's my name over there?...".<br />
<br />
She started reading, it had a picture of a potato at the start of it, she thought that was weird but also funny, <br />
she read through the whole thing and started reading the next chapter, <br />
Littletato thought about making a comment on it, she created an account to do it, <br />
and she commented in the first chapter of the story of stake2 saying:<br />
"<i>Hey... it looks like I'm in this story... that is weird, are you stalking me or something?, <br />
I feel observed, like there's a lot of cameras looking at me right now O_O, <br />
how did you write this, and why?... and how did you know about all that stuff?</i>".<br />
<br />
Then after a few minutes, stake2 replied saying:<br />
"<i>Hey... I am your creator Littletato, I created you in... 05/08/2017 I guess, <br />
I created an account here at Wattpad, and I created a story just to test the website,<br />
I thought about "potato" and it became you and your story, "Life of Littletato", <br />
it has a website too, I created you and your reality, you live in a different universe than mine, <br />
I am not the Izaque of the SpaceLiving universe, I'm the Izaque of the Earth universe, <br />
I loved to create you, Pequenata/Littletato, you're my creation, and I love you... &lt;3 :3</i>"<br />
<br />
Then Littletato worked and ate afternoon breakfast with Julia, <br />
after that she opened her laptop and opened the VegeWattpad page, <br />
she opened the page of the first chapter of Life of Littletato, <br />
she started writing a reply to stake2's comment, to the comment of Izaque, she replied saying:<br />
"<i>Hey Izaque... so you're my creator right?, now I see you as a father... <br />
my reality was created by you right?... so I guess I'm happy because of that, <br />
thanks for creating me Izaque, thanks for giving life to this story, <br />
I love you so much Izaque... thank you, I'm really glad because of that... <br />
I love the fact that you gave Julia and Lisa to me, and that experience with SpaceLiving was awesome!, <br />
thank you, also, can I have your Discord?, thank you Izaque, I love you, my creator, <br />
my father, my Daddy &lt;3 :3, I hope you have a good day or a good night... thank you, I love you &lt;3 :3</i>"<br />
<br />
She posted the comment and felt relieved, she was getting a lot of things out of her chest, <br />
she watched an anime and turned off her laptop after that, then slept with Julia, <br />
awaiting for Izaque's answer, it was a cold night, she hugged Julia tight, and slept a happy night.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
It was raining in the next morning, Littletato wanted to go to work and she was prepared, <br />
she had an umbrella, she woke up, ate breakfast with Julia and said goodbye to her, <br />
Julia said goodbye back, Littletato started walking to her job while listening to a Chillstep mixtape on Vegetube, <br />
she arrived there while using the umbrella, then she entered the building, <br />
closed it and stored it on one of the cabinets of the building, she walked to her desk, <br />
sat on the chair and started fixing an app that had bugs, after that, <br />
she wanted a coffee break because she was tired, Mia, her coworker was there, <br />
Littletato talked with Mia about things like jobs, life, relationships, <br />
Mia said she was single, Littletato said she was dating someone, Mia said "Good luck with your partner!" and Littletato said "Thank you!", Mia asked Littletato:<br />
"Can I come to your house someday?".<br />
<br />
Littletato replied:<br />
"Sure... when do you want to visit me?"<br />
<br />
Mia said:<br />
"Next week maybe? on Friday..."<br />
<br />
Littletato replied:<br />
"That sounds like a good day, feel free to come by"<br />
<br />
Mia replied:<br />
"Thank you!"<br />
<br />
After that, Littletato came back to work and after the job was over, <br />
she walked back home and hugged Julia, then ate the afternoon breakfast with her, <br />
she gave some food to Lisa too, Littletato was excited to see Izaque's reply, <br />
she turned on her laptop and opened VegeWattpad again, a notification appeared saying that Izaque replied to her comment.<br />
<br />
Izaque replied saying:<br />
"<i>Hey Littletato, I love you, my daughter, my little blossom :3, <br />
I'll send you my Vegecord id on the messages of VegeWattpad okay? &lt;3</i>"<br />
<br />
Then Izaque sent his Vegecord id on the inbox of Littletato, <br />
she added him and started talking with him, she thanked him for creating her, <br />
and he said that he is very proud of creating her, Littletato said to Izaque:<br />
"<i>Thanks, Daddy &lt;3</i>".<br />
<br />
After that, Littletato listened to some music and talked to some friends on Vegecord and Vegebook, <br />
then she closed her laptop and came to her room to sleep with Julia, she hugged Julia and slept with her.<br />

﻿<b>Title: The beautiful Life of Littletato ❤️</b><br /><br />
(The beautiful Life of Littletato, with much love, Izaque)<br />
Littletato was dreaming about being a unicorn in the land of Equestria, she was a purple pony who likes books, and she had five friends, one was yellow, another one was blue, the other was pink, another one was white, the last one was orange, she liked all of her friends, and she knew how to do spells, Littletato also had a friend called Spike, who was able to send her messages to a princess that rules Equestria, her name was Celestia.<br />
<br />
The name of Littletato in that land was Twilight Sparkle, she was in her crystal castle, reading some books, a book called "The story of the land of Equestria", it was about six ponies who were super friends and liked to have fun together, and about some humans in the planet Earth who liked to watch that cartoon, because that book was the book version of the cartoon that existed on Earth, it talked about anons and humans that watched that show too, one human was called Izaque, he was using his computer to write a story about a potato on the internet, and that chapter was about a specific cartoon being a dream of the character of the potato story, the story of the potato was called tatoLittle, Izaque was so happy to write that, a story that he loves a lot (tatoLittle) and a cartoon that he loves a lot (My Little Pony), Twilight Sparkle(Littletato) was reading that story, she thought it was a pretty good one and she liked the character of Izaque, because it reminded her about her creator, Izaque.<br />
<br />
She thinks he is having fun there, creating her story, having fun while writing, she is so thankful to him, because he created her, he gave life to Littletato, and she loves Izaque, she is so happy because of him, and he is so happy because of her.<br />
<br />
Then, Littletato, while being Twilight Sparkle, notices that a portal has opened inside her crystal castle, an old friend of her from Earth, Izaque, was inside it, he had beautiful yellow wings of fire and a yellow hand-grappling hook made of lava fluid, he steps out the purple portal and talks with her:<br />
<br />
"Hey Twilight Sparkle, how are you?" he asks.<br />
<br />
"I'm good, and you Izaque?" she replies.<br />
<br />
"Me too, long time no see right?" he says.<br />
<br />
Then Twilight replies: "Yea, but you're here now, and I'm happy because of that".<br />
<br />
Then Izaque told Twilight that he was talking with a friend of him, a friend from a distant place, Izaque was sat in the blue and comfy carpet that Twilight had, she stopped reading her book to listen to him.<br />
<br />
"Her name is Littletato... I'm her creator, you know... I wrote this story in 2016, it was called Littletato too, it was so awesome, and is still so awesome to write that, I felt incredible and happy" explains Izaque.<br />
<br />
"Oh... that is very great to hear Izaque!, I'm glad you're having so much fun writing it, 2016 was a long time in Earth right? like... 365 days, you're inspiring me to write a story Izaque!, that makes me soooo happy" replies Twilight.<br />
<br />
Then Izaque says: "Yea, a very long time, well... today right now in Earth is the year of 2019, I'm glad you're inspired by me Twilight, that makes me so much happy!, I would love to teach you how to write something!" says him.<br />
<br />
"I would love that!, please teach me, Izaque-sensei (teacher)" replies Twilight.<br />
<br />
Then Twilight asks: "Soo... how do you spoke with her? was it good?".<br />
<br />
"Yes, it was pretty good, well, I think she saw the Littletato story on Wattpad and asked for my Discord id, I gave it to her then she added me, thanked me for everything that I did, even if what I did was just create a story, I'm thankful for meeting her, my creation, haha, that was weird", explains Izaque.<br />
<br />
"Oh, that is a pretty good way of meeting someone, even though I don't know what Discord is, is it a network work that Discord created or something?, how can you two connect that way?, sometimes I can't understand Discord, ugh..." says Twilight.<br />
<br />
"Well, Twilight, it isn't the Discord of this land, you know, Discord is only the name for a social network that exists on Earth, a technology network where people can talk with each other, I also can't understand him, never..." replies Izaque.<br />
<br />
Then Littletato, in the body of Twilight was happy because she was talking with Izaque personally, even if she was a pony from Equestria, she loved that moment, she wished Julia was there with her, then, suddenly, she was Asuna from Japanese animation or anime called Sword Art Online, she was fighting by the side of Kirito, which reminded her of Izaque, and Silica was there too, Littletato(Asuna) thought that Silica reminded her of Julia, so cute and innocent, then she was in Yuru Camp, she was Shimarin, a camping girl, she was sat by the side of Nadeshiko which reminded her of Julia and Chiaki which reminded her of Izaque, suddenly she was in the body of Izaque, it felt weird, being him, he was writing a story called Littletato, he was so happy, Izaque was talking with his friends on Discord, Igor, Duda, CoffeeMedio, Naty Mira, he loved to have company while writing, Littletato thought that that was incredible, feeling all of his emotions and sensations, she loved to be in his place, she wished she was there with him, by him side, talking, chatting, doing things together, she thought she was loving him, but no, she only wanted to be his friend, because he is so incredible to her, he is everything for her, she loved Julia and Izaque very much, she is still dreaming, still thinking, still imaging, she loves her life, she loves to be where she is right now, with her friends, with Izaque, thinking about all the things that she can do, everything that she could do right now, she wants, she wants to live her life so much right now, with all of her dreamings reminding her about what she haves, she loves Izaque very much, Littletato is gonna have a good sleep tonight, a reaaally good sleep, and good dreams, (goodnight you too, there, reading this story right now, I don't know who you are, but I probably love you, thank you for reading this!, I love you so much, my reader, and if you're a friend of mine on Discord screenshot this part and send it to me!, thanks for reading, I'm Izaque, I live in 2019 while writing this, goodnight, good dreams, love you!, peace! <3)<br />
<br />
