In the year of 2019, there was a tale of a spaceship that had an entire house inside it.<br />
That spaceship had a fridge and a bathroom with a laser toilet bowl that melts the things inside it.<br />
And people who got those spaceships were people that just liked to stay in their rooms.<br />
Alone and doing things like using the computer and playing video games.<br />
A lot of those people that had spaceships were teens, they were alone and depressive.<br />
By some reason, they were teleported to those spaceships.<br />
One of those people was Lisa, a girl of 16 years old.<br />
She played games, used the fridge for eating, wrote stories on her computer.<br />
She lived there, lived her life there doing the stuff she loved to.<br />
She woke up, Lisa had a beautiful room in her spaceship.<br />
A room with pink colors, a computer, a PlayStation 4, a fridge, a bathroom with a laser toilet bowl.<br />
A bed and a Nintendo 3DS.<br />
She loved to stay there, to write stories, to play games and listen to some dubstep and Japanese songs on her computer.<br />
Today she had nothing to do, but she wanted to play some games.<br />
She turned her computer on and sat on the chair, she then opened Steam and waited for it to open.<br />
She opened Titanfall 2 to play a little.<br />
She loved that game, she entered a multi-player match.<br />
She made a 10/3, she liked that match.<br />
Then she closed Steam and opened Firefox and Spotify.<br />
She selected a Dubstep song to blast on her speakers.<br />
Then she opened Facebook to talk with her friends.<br />
She talked with her friend Anny.<br />
"How are you, Anny?", said Lisa.<br />
"I'm good, and you?", said Anny.<br />
"I'm good too, what are you doing right now?", said Lisa.<br />
"Playing God of War in my PS4", said Anny.<br />
"Oh, that's cool, I'm gonna make something else right now", said Lisa.<br />
"Ok", said Anny.<br />
Then Lisa turned her PS4 on and grabbed the controller.<br />
She also opened her Music player on her computer which was named Foobar and closed Spotify.<br />
She had lots of GBs of music, she liked to have such a big library.<br />
Then Lisa opened GTA V and started playing, she played the online mode.<br />
She was playing with her friends, also she was listening to the song "Geoxor - Turn Around" in her music player.<br />
She liked that song, Lisa had two monitors, one for the computer and one for the PS4.<br />
Lisa noticed she was hungry, she became afk in the game and placed her controller in the desk.<br />
She got up and opened the fridge, it was an automatic fridge that brought anything the person wants.<br />
You could think of a pizza and a pizza would appear inside the fridge.<br />
Then Lisa grabbed the cup of chocolate milk that was in the fridge.<br />
And also the hamburger, she sat at her desk.<br />
Lisa also liked to watch movies.<br />
And series, anime, cartoons.<br />
She downloads that stuff with utorrent.<br />
After some time playing, she said to her friends that she was going to do another thing.<br />
She liked Marvel and its movies, she had downloaded "The Avengers: Infinite War".<br />
She grabbed a bowl of Doritos and a bottle of Coca-cola to watch the movie.<br />
She opened her video player that was called VLC Media Player.<br />
Lisa opened the mkv file of Infinite War in the video player.<br />
And then she watched the movie, she loved the movie, all the action, and stuff, the heroes.<br />
Then after some time, she got tired and turned her computer and PS4 off.<br />
Her body was tired, she laid in her bed and slept, she had a dream.<br />
Where she was going to school, and also had to clean her room and house of her parents.<br />
Lisa also had to work, for her that dream was a nightmare.<br />
Then after some time, that dream disappeared and another dream took its place, a better dream.<br />
She was dreaming of being in her computer listening to dubstep songs and talking to her friends on Discord.<br />
She liked that dream and wanted to wake up just to use Discord and talk to her friends.<br />
Lisa liked what she had, that spaceship, the bed, computer, PS4, and Nintendo 3DS.<br />
She wanted to play, to watch, to write and to talk.<br />
She wanted to be alone, and to have her things to do.<br />
And that is her life.<br />

Still, in the year 2019, there was this tale, of a super innovative spaceship.<br />
The company that made those spaceships were called by the name ThinkOutsiteTheBox.<br />
The spaceships were called "LonelyShips" because you were lonely there.<br />
There were a lot of people that lived in the LonelyShips, they created a community.<br />
And a lot of Discord servers to communicate and talk about being a LonelyShipper.<br />
It was like a movement, a social movement, just like the bronies, furries and 4channers were some years ago.<br />
These three specific movements are still active, but they aren't as famous as before.<br />
They liked to be in that movement, Lisa didn't participate in that.<br />
She was just her, spending her own time at the computer, without a movement or stereotype.<br />
There was also a boy named John, he had 17 years old, he liked to play games.<br />
A lot of games, he was very competitive at them and didn't like to lose.<br />
He was at his LonelyShip, he didn't know what time was on earth.<br />
He only wanted to play games, he was thinking about some things while being laid at his bed.<br />
He thought: "Why I am at this bed?, I was really alone, and I wanted to stay away from the others,<br />
Because they enraged me, I was suffering because of them, and I was being annoyed by them too,<br />
Also, I feel that I was someone in another place or alternate universe,<br />
Like I was some kind of hero or teacher of martial arts like I was teaching some friends,<br />
And was teaching two persons, Juju and Sizaque I think,<br />
I should stop thinking about that, maybe I'm too tired or something, I should get back to the computer".<br />
Then John got off his bed and turned the computer on, he opened Steam to play some games.<br />
John also had a friend called Mark, John felt that they were friends on an alternate universe.<br />
John opened Apex Legends to play, it was a new game that EA launched, he wanted to test it.<br />
He played for a few minutes and liked it, he was very good at the game.<br />
Then he closed the game and called his friend Mark to play some Overwatch on Discord.<br />
They played a little while talking by voice-call, Mark also lived in a LonelyShip.<br />
After some time playing John won some rounds and wanted to exit, he said "See you later" to Mark.<br />
Mark said the same, John liked to read some stories on the internet, he wanted to write too.<br />
But he wasn't very good at it, he liked to read the stories of a girl named Lisa, that was a LonelyShipper too.<br />
Lisa has published a lot of stories, she loved to write those ones.<br />
John was studying writing and stories to learn a little, he has made some drafts on his computer.<br />
He wanted to talk to Lisa, to ask her for help on writing, he noticed that she puts her Discord name and id in all of her stories.<br />
The text said: "If you want help in writing or like my stories and want to talk about them just add me on Discord: Lisa#1321".<br />
Then John added her on Discord, John already liked and commented on the chapters of some stories of Lisa.<br />
But he wanted to talk to her and to ask questions to her, about writing and how to write better.<br />
--(Author: And what I'm doing right now? writing, inception.)<br />
John sent a message to her, he said: "Hi, how are you?, I'm John from Wattpad, I love your stories".<br />
"You wrote your Discord on your stories, right? you said people could ask for help in writing or talk about your stories".<br />
"Sorry for asking so many questions, It's that I started just some months ago, and was trying to get better at writing".<br />
After some time John noticed that she was online, he got excited to receive a reply.<br />
Lisa replied: "Hey, John, I know you from Wattpad :), your comment and give me a lot of likes, thanks for loving my stories,<br />
And thanks for commenting and liking them, yes, I did that, you can ask for help or talk with me about my stories :3,<br />
It's ok asking questions, I started some months ago too, can I see a piece of your work? like, the story you're most proud of".<br />
Them John replied: "Yes, I will send a text file, ok?".<br />
"Ok then", said Lisa.<br />
Then John sent Lisa a file named "The Return of the Beast.txt" of 4KB.<br />
After some time reading Lisa started writing a message to John, she said:<br />
"That was cool to read, the story was interesting, but the way you executed it, that was a little..."<br />
John: "Bad?".<br />
Lisa: "Not bad, but, was not... the way you express yourself, or the way you write, like, try to read more".<br />
Lisa: "Try to read more and to learn more about how to use words, and how to form phrases, I guess that's my Monika Tip-".<br />
Lisa: "I mean, I guess that's my tip for you, try that".<br />
John: "Ok, I will try that, thanks for helping me, like, I was scared and excited to talk to you".<br />
Lisa: "Why?".<br />
John: "Cause I loved your work, and thought you were an inaccessible person".<br />
Lisa: "If I were inaccessible why I would put my discord tag in my stories?, also I live in a LonelyShip, so I'm very accessible".<br />
John: "Oh, that's cool, I live in one too, what is your age?".<br />
Lisa: "16, and you? my name is Lisa btw".<br />
John: "17, my name is John".<br />
Lisa: "Ok John, I liked to talk to you, but I'm gonna write some "The Odds of Nature" right now, ok?".<br />
John: "Ok, sorry to bother you".<br />
Lisa: "You didn't bother me, also I want to read your stories when you get better :)".<br />
John: "It would be an honor to send you some of them :D".<br />
Lisa: "Ok, see you later John :3".<br />
John: "See you later Lisa :)".<br />
After that John minimized his Discord and started searching how to write better and how to use words better.<br />
He wanted to get better at writing to show Lisa his stories, he was super excited to do that.<br />
He learned a lot and was trying to make some drafts.<br />
After some time writing he wrote something that he liked, he was tired, he yawned and relaxed back in the chair.<br />
He turned off his computer and laid in bed to sleep, he wanted to talk to Lisa again.<br />
He slept.<br />

John woke up and turned his computer on, he opened the fridge and picked up a lemon cake.<br />
He placed the plate with the lemon cake in the table where the computer was.<br />
He opened Steam to play some games, he played Transport Defender and Zombidle for 30 minutes.<br />
After that he opened Notepad++ to write some stories, or maybe one draft that he was trying to make better.<br />
He worked a little on it and thought it was good, he saved the file, then after he downloaded some videos of Youtube to watch.<br />
He downloaded 3 videos of Alanzoka and 3 of Cellbit Jogando.<br />
John had a site where he placed the videos and a green button called "Watch" was added linking to his local video file.<br />
He watched some videos and then closed the tab of the site, he used VLC Media Player to watch those videos.<br />
John also liked to play Minecraft, he had 3 servers in his Minecraft Server List.<br />
He liked to play survival and skyblock on those servers, John liked the "Fanbase" of those servers.<br />
John played a little in those servers, he had friends there.<br />
He closed the game and started to talk to his friends in Discord, he liked the friends he had.<br />
It was 11:00AM there, but he didn't know the difference between day and night because he didn't have light or a sun close to there.<br />
Then the scene changed to Lisa, she was writing The Odds of Nature, she finished the current chapter and saved.<br />
After that she posted her story to Wattpad, after some minutes the chapter had 5 views and 2 comments.<br />
Lisa was happy about that, she liked to have a fanbase or to have people that liked to read what she write.<br />
After that, Lisa opened Netflix to watch some series, she liked to watch The Walking Dead.<br />
Lisa was in the second episode of the seventh season, she liked the story and the characters, but also was a little scared to watch.<br />
The Discord app was open on her computer, when she started watching The Walking Dead S07E03, the details of what she was watching appeared on her Discord profile.<br />
She paused the video playback and got some popcorn and coca-cola from her fridge, she liked to eat popcorn while watching things,<br />
Then she sat at her chair and played the video, she ate while watching, then the episode ended, she closed the Netflix app.<br />
Then Lisa switched to Discord, she wanted to talk with her friends on Discord, she noticed that John was online.<br />
Lisa started to talk with him, she said: "Hi, you got better at writing?".<br />
After some time John replied saying: "Yes, I searched on the internet how to get better at writing, I wrote a draft today".<br />
Then Lisa said: "Oh, that's cool, can I see it?".<br />
John said: "Yes, of course, I will send the file to you?, ok?".<br />
Then Lisa replied: "Ok".<br />
John sent her a file named: "Bubbles and Creams.txt" of 5KB.<br />
Lisa said: "I will read this now".<br />
After some time Lisa replied saying: "I think this is better than the other story you sent me, like... the way you wrote it".<br />
"The grammar is better too, I liked the story, I think the concept is interesting, you should publish it somewhere, like Wattpad".<br />
"I would be happy to read it on Wattpad :)".<br />
Then John replied: "Oh, ok, I'm happy that you think that about my story, I tried to get better at writing just because I admire you so much".<br />
"And I wanted to make you proud of me or something, so thanks for liking my story, and thanks for helping me get better at writing".<br />
"I will post it on Wattpad, thanks for the suggestion".<br />
Then Lisa replied: "Oh, I'm happy to help you and to inspire you too, thanks for that :)".<br />
"I'm gonna make something else now, ok, see you later :3".<br />
Then John replied: "See you later".<br />
Lisa was so happy that she inspired John to get better at writing, that made her want to do more stories, and to write more.<br />
Then Lisa opened Steam to play some games, she opened Apex Legends to play a little.<br />
She liked the game, she wanted to play more, but was a little tired to play.<br />
She won a match and closed the game, she had other friends on Discord too.<br />
Lisa wanted to talk to Anny, to play a little and stuff, Anny had a Discord too.<br />
Then Lisa sent a message to Anny on Discord saying: "Hey, want to play a little today?".<br />
Then Anny replied: "Yes, I would like to do that, but what you want to play?".<br />
Lisa said: "I don't know, just a little GTA V, or Terraria if you want".<br />
Anny said: "I would like to play both".<br />
Then Lisa and Anny entered a private server on Discord to go on a voice-call, Lisa called a Music Bot to the voice-call to listen to some music while playing.<br />
Lisa and Anny played GTA V Online a little, they liked that game, then after that Lisa said that she was going to do something else.<br />
Lisa was looking into Wattpad for some stories to read, she discovered that the "Life of Littletato" received a new chapter, the Chapter 18.<br />
The story was written by a user called "2ekats", Lisa liked that story, she liked to see Littletato and Julia living their lives.<br />
She loved the chapter she gave it a vote and commented on it, after some minutes the author replied her saying:<br />
"Hi, thanks for voting on my story, and thanks for liking and commenting on it, I'm really happy to see your feedback and your comments".<br />
Lisa was happy to give feedback and to comment on the stories she liked.<br />
Then she turned her Playstation 4 on and opened a game called Need For Speed, she liked to play that.<br />
Lisa played for some time and closed the game, she turned her video game off.<br />
She felt hungry, she opened the fridge and there was a packet of chocolate stuffed biscuit and a Doritos on there, also a cup of coca-cola.<br />
Lisa picked up all the things and placed them on her table, she opened the packet of biscuit and she dropped them on a plastic bowl.<br />
She opened a movie on Netflix to watch, the movie was called "The Avengers: Infinite War".<br />
She watched while eating the biscuits, Doritos and drinking coca-cola, she liked the movie, and she added it to her list of "Watched Movies".<br />
Lisa loved to make text files, she had a friend called Funkysnipa Cat, she knew him on Google+.<br />
Funkysnipa Cat was the first to start the conversation on Discord, Funkysnipa Cat and Lisa were native speakers of the Brazilian Portuguese language.<br />
Funkysnipa Cat said in Brazilian Portuguese: "Hi".<br />
Then Lisa said: "Hi".<br />
They talked a little and started to know each other again, they liked to talk about stories, they had a lot in common.<br />
Funky and Lisa loved to write stories, and Lisa wanted to write together with Funky some time.<br />
The real name of Funky was Izaque, Lisa liked to be his friend.<br />
After some time learning about each other, Izaque discovered that Lisa lived in a LonelyShip.<br />
Izaque lived in the normal Planet Earth, Izaque thought that was an interesting fact about Lisa.<br />
On the beginning of the conversation Izaque sent Lisa the link of his Wattpad profile, Lisa and Izaque talked about stories for a while.<br />
They also played together some times, actually the author of this story is Izaque or Funkysnipa Cat.<br />
Yes, that's it, I'm Izaque and I'm writing about Lisa, my dear friend, that's a little weird to do right?.<br />
Because a lot of stories don't talk with the reader, they tell a story to the reader, but its simply that, I'm writing a story about my friend Lisa.<br />
I'm thinking you probably have a face like this now: "O_O".<br />
Back to Narrator style.<br />
Lisa said to Izaque what she did on the days she spent on that spaceship, so he could write the Chapters of the story "SpaceLiving".<br />
Izaque loved to write that story (*wink*).<br />
Izaque analyzed the day of Lisa and wrote a story about that, then he sent the story file to Lisa.<br />
Lisa liked and gave permission to Izaque to publish the story and to send the story to his friends.<br />
Izaque loved when a specific friend read SpaceLiving, that friend was more than a friend, that person was called [...] (...).<br />
Lisa loved to talk to Izaque, Lisa also knew that [...] liked to read her story.<br />
Lisa wanted to talk to her, Lisa asked for the contact of [...], Izaque said that she could talk to [...].<br />
Then [...] started the conversation with Lisa, they talked a little, Isa started to know Lisa a little more.<br />
Then after some time they stopped talking.<br />
Lisa thought that she had a happy life, she wrote stories, she had some good friends like Izaque, Isa and John.<br />
She felt tired, she said goodbye to Izaque and turned the computer off.<br />
She then laid on her bed and slept.<br />

There was a boy that lived in a LonelyShip too, his name was "Ted".<br />
But his spaceship was different, it had a teletransporter.<br />
He could go back to Earth when he wanted to.<br />
To see his family, and to know about the news of the Earth.<br />
He was a little famous in his city, being one of the only people who could leave their LonelyShips.<br />
He liked his life, he was still a civilian on Earth, but he liked to live in his LonelyShip.<br />
One day he was sat in his computer, eating some lasagna with coca-cola while watching a livestream of the Youtuber Cellbit.<br />
Then after eating he got up and picked up a bottle of water, he placed the bottle on the table.<br />
Ted then dragged the livestream window to his second screen, and opened Netflix on the Mozilla Firefox browser.<br />
He took a look at the catalog, he didn't found anything that he was interested to watch.<br />
Then he closed the browser and the livestream, and opened Steam to play some games, he started playing Terraria.<br />
He played on a multi-player server, he played for a little and then closed the game.<br />
Ted missed his family and the life in Earth, he turned off his computer and activated the teletransporter.<br />
After waiting some time, the teletransporter was ready, he entered it and typed the id of Planet Earth.<br />
He has been teleported to Earth, and appeared on the house of his parents.<br />
His parents were eating, they noticed that Ted was there, they got up to hug Ted.<br />
The parents of Ted said they missed him, and they cried a little together.<br />
Then his parents said they were gonna go to the market.<br />
The parents of Ted left the house and Ted said he was going to downtown.<br />
Ted locked the house and got a backpack with somethings.<br />
After walking a little Ted arrived at downtown, he wanted to see a friend of him.<br />
That he talked with on the internet, he also had a smartphone on his LonelyShip.<br />
His dad was called Pedro, his mom was called Jana.<br />
Ted meet his friend 2 years ago.<br />
His friend was a girl called Monika, he knew where she lived.<br />
Ted sent a message to Monika through his smartphone saying that he was coming to her house.<br />
Monika said she was happy about that, and that she was excited to see him again.<br />
Then Ted started walking to her house, he arrived and knocked on the door.<br />
Monika then opened the door and let Ted in.<br />
Then Monika told Ted to feel at home.<br />
Ted entered the house and sat on the couch.<br />
Monika asked if he wanted some water, Ted replied positively.<br />
Then Monika brought a glass of water.<br />
Ted drank it and gave it back to Monika.<br />
Monika then came back to the kitchen and placed the cup on the sink.<br />
Monika came back to the living room and sat at the couch.<br />
Ted was a little uncomfortable because of that.<br />
He wasn't used to being so close to a person like that.<br />
Then Monika asked how he was doing, Ted said he was doing great.<br />
Monika said that she liked him, they both looked in the eyes of each other.<br />
Ted was blushing a little and said that he liked Monika too.<br />
Then Ted asked if Monika liked to live that way, in Earth.<br />
Monika was a little uncomfortable about that question.<br />
She took a while to reply.<br />
Then Monika said she liked that, but she would like to live as a LonelyShipper.<br />
Ted asked if she wanted to spend some time there.<br />
Monika said she wanted, but she was afraid of letting her house alone.<br />
Then Ted said that she could call someone trustworthy to take care of the house.<br />
Monika said that that was a good idea, then she said that she was going to think about that for a while.<br />
Ted said that was good to see her again, and that she was still beautiful.<br />
Monika blushed a little and said "Thank you!".<br />
Then Monika said that he was beautiful too.<br />
Ted said "Thank you...".<br />
Monika said: "Don't you want to stay for a coffee?".<br />
Ted replied: "Oh, okay".<br />
Then Monika got up and walked towards the kitchen, she started making coffee.<br />
Ted sat at the chair and waited for Monika to prepare the coffee.<br />
They talked a little and then the coffee was ready.<br />
Monika and Ted sat at the table and Monika poured some coffee and milk for Ted.<br />
Ted said: "Hmm... I wanna ask you something...".<br />
Then Monika said: "What?".<br />
Ted said: "A pretty girl like you must have a boyfriend right?".<br />
Then Monika replied blushed and shy: "Oh... haha, thank you Ted but I don't have a boyfriend".<br />
Ted said: "Oh... so... we already know each other a lot right?".<br />
Monika said: "Y-yes... and I really like you...".<br />
Ted said: "Me too...".<br />
Monika got closer to Ted and said: "So... do you like me more than a friend?...".<br />
Ted said: "What do you mean?...".<br />
Monika said: "That... like... as a girlfriend?".<br />
Ted was a little shy and said: "Uhh... maybe... like... do you want to be my girlfriend?".<br />
Monika blushed and said: "Y-yes...".<br />
Then Ted hugged Monika, Monika kissed Ted.<br />
Monika said: "I want to go with you to your LonelyShip...".<br />
Ted said: "You're sure about that?".<br />
Monika said: "Yes!, I love you!".<br />
Ted said: "I love you too honey, I'm happy that you want to live with me".<br />
Monika said: "I'm happy too...".<br />
Then Monika started packing up her things.<br />
Monika gave her house to a relative and picked up the $30.000 dollars she had in a bank account.<br />
Then Monika came to the house of Ted and they were prepared to teleport to the LonelyShip.<br />
They teleported and got off the teletransporter. <br />
When Monika got off the teletransporter the spaceship began to shake a little and the tables and walls were moving and changing.<br />
After sometime a new computer, PS4, bed, bathroom and fridge was there.<br />
Monika placed her stuff on the floor and got closer to the bed, on the wall of the bed was some buttons.<br />
She pushed a pink button and the bed, fridge, table and walls got painted pink.<br />
Monika said: "This is awesome!", and hugged Ted.<br />
Ted said: "Yes, it is!".<br />
There was also a wardrobe there, Monika stored her things there.<br />
She laid on her bed and said: "This spaceship is really cool".<br />
Ted said: "Yea".<br />
Monika was prepared to start a new life in that spaceship, doing a lot of things and being with her love.<br />
Ted said: "This isn't a LonelyShip anymore, its a LovelyShip, haha".<br />
Monika said: "Yea, lol".<br />

<i>*A message appears on the screen you're reading this...*<br />

Its the end of the change-log, this was written by ThinkOutsideTheBox, defend yourself from the asteroids, stay safe, take care, and be lonely! :)".<br />
*The message disappears...*</i><br />
A LonelyShipper was seeing this message, she was in her LonelyShip, the walls of the spaceship had the Navy Blue color,<br />
She had a Bed, ThoughtPoweredFridge, Bathroom, a Computer, Smartphone and PS4, she also had a Musical Keyboard,<br />
She loved to learn and train with the keyboard, she was very good at it, some time she sent a cover of the song "Faded" to a friend,<br />
That friend was called Izaque, Izaque liked the music cover, and said that Wendy had talent,<br />
Wendy was very happy reading that, Wendy also liked to play some games on her computer,<br />
She loved to eat too, because it was easy to eat on a LonelyShip, you just think about the food, open the Fridge and the food will be there,<br />
Izaque liked to write some stories, he would sent the link of a new chapter to Wendy every time he made one,<br />
Wendy liked to read the stories of Izaque, Izaque thought that Wendy was a really good friend, and he liked to talk to her,<br />
They talked using Discord, when Izaque learned that Wendy was a LonelyShipper too, he became happier than before,<br />
Izaque loved his LonelyShip, Wendy too, Izaque loved to listen to some Dubstep in his Ship, blasting it on the speakers,<br />
Izaque also made livestreams on Twitch, showing what he was doing, to his subscribers,<br />
He liked to download songs from SoundCloud, to play games on Steam, to write stories and post on Wattpad, Fanfiction and in the sites that he made by himself,<br />
Wendy liked to listen to some chill music, and to watch videos on Youtube, <br />
One day Izaque was reading a really good and atmospheric story on the Fimfiction website,<br />
It was about the My Little Pony cartoon and the Don't Starve game together, he recommended the story to Wendy,<br />
He liked so much those two things, and those things together were better than anything,<br />
There was one day where Izaque didn't made a livestream, he watched a movie called The Avengers: Infinite War,<br />
He ate pizzas, hamburgers and lots of coca-cola while watching the two hour movie,<br />
He loved to do that, watch that awesome movie, Izaque added the movie to his watched list on his website called Watch History,<br />
Izaque also used a software on his computer called Foobar2000, which was a Music Player, Izaque had 25Gigabytes of music on his hard drive,<br />
He liked to have a lot of music, and he called himself a Music Hoarder,<br />
Izaque was also a friend of one of the founders of ThinkOutsideTheBox, he liked the new Update they made to the LonelyShips,<br />
The Double-Ship, WallColorChange, ShipInvite, EquipmentChange, he liked all the new changes and new features,<br />
Izaque sure loved to be a LonelyShipper and to live in a LonelyShip,<br />
He even created a Discord Server about it, and talked to a lot of friends on Discord about how to become a LonelyShipper,<br />
Wendy also liked to sleep, and to play some keyboard on her spaceship, she loved to be a LonelyShipper,<br />
Back when she was still in earth, she wanted to live alone, she liked to use the computer and smartphone,<br />
She liked to see the stars, the planets and the earth from her window,<br />
Wendy had some luck too, because no asteroids crossed the way of her spaceship,<br />
Izaque had an asteroid coming in the direction of his spaceship, then the security system activated and a big laser turret appeared in the top of the spaceship,<br />
Destroying the asteroid completely, Izaque wasn't scared by the asteroid, because he knew how the spaceship worked, and knewthat it would protect him,<br />
He loved to study and to learn about the LonelyShips, SpaceLiving and the ThinkOutsideTheBox company,<br />
With the new update 1.3.709, Izaque and Wendy could visit their families, they liked that, to see them again,<br />
Izaque missed his family, he hugged all of them, his sisters, his brother, his father and mother,<br />
He was used to being in earth and to talk to humans, even if he had spent a lot of time inside the LonelyShip,<br />
Izaque asked if someone wanted to live there with him, but no one wanted,<br />
Then he said "See you later" to all of them, he came inside the Teleporter that was in the house of his parents,<br />
And came back to the LonelyShip, a robot female voice greeted him, saying: "Welcome back, Izaque",<br />
Izaque installed that voice using the Desktop App "SpaceLiving ThinkOutsideTheBox",<br />
The spaceship of Izaque already had a lot of good things and good equipment, a good screen, PS4,<br />
Good computer, good internet, he was happy with what he had,<br />
He wanted to talk more with Lisa, Wendy, Igor and other friends he had on Discord,<br />
He wanted to talk more in the "Discord do Cellbit" server,<br />
Izaque was tired, he listened to some Dubstep music on his computer, then watched a small episode of the anime Eromanga Sensei while eating chocolate cookies,<br />
He added the episode to his Watched List and turned off the computer, he laid in his bed and slept.<br />

(This is the explanation of a... let me create a cool name for that... a "SpaceLivingTeleportExperience")<br />
It was a beautiful day in the SpaceLiving world, even if there's no sun close to the spaceships.<br />
Lisa, Izaque, Wendy, John, Ted and Monika were all inside their spaceships, living happy and using the computer.<br />
Lisa was drawing a little while watching an anime called "Eromanga Sensei", she felt inspired by that, because it had an girl that drew too.<br />
She was happy drawing while watching her favorite anime, it was funny, cute, happy, she loved it.<br />
The anime tell the story of a little sister that draw erotic drawings, and an older brother that write stories and light novels.<br />
Lisa loved to watch that anime, she was re watching it for the twenty-third time.<br />
She had it download in HD on her computer, just to watch again and again.<br />
The anime reminded her of her older brother, she loved him very much.<br />
But then she got depressed, sad and just wanted to stay in her room, he was sad about that.<br />
She was hungry all day, but didn't had the motivation to eat.<br />
She just stayed on her room, the lights were dimmed out, she was doing things at her computer.<br />
Then she reached a point in her life that she was weak and skinny, she realized that her life was bad.<br />
Lisa wanted to get out of there, she was afraid, she wanted to go to school just to make her parents happy.<br />
Her family was sad about her, she wanted to get out of there, when she slept, was 05:12 in the morning.<br />
She was sleeping in her bed, she had a dream, a dream where she got teleported to a spaceship that had white walls.<br />
A Computer, PS4, a Fridge that creates any food you think about, a bed, a wardrobe, a smartphone on the table.<br />
She thought that was incredible and awesome, to have all the things you need to use the computer.<br />
To have food and water when you want, and to have a super-good computer.<br />
She wanted to stay there forever, her eyes were shining bright.<br />
Everything was new to her, she got closer to the table and turned the computer on by pressing the button on the computer cabinet.<br />
It loaded Windows 10, it was as if she had formatted the computer, she typed the name of the user.<br />
A password, and then the Windows 10 home screen appeared, it had Mozilla Firefox, Spotify, Windows Explorer and the SpaceLiving Desktop App installed.<br />
She opened Firefox, the home page was DuckDuckGo, the favorites of the browser were: DuckDuckGo, YouTube, Facebook, SoundCloud, SuperAnimes, Wattpad, MyAnimeList.<br />
She opened YouTube and logged in her account.<br />
Then Lisa opened DuckDuckGo and download Youtube-DLG, it was an app that she used in her personal computer.<br />
The computer also had Steam installed, Lisa logged in her Steam account.<br />
She opened Windows Explorer, she saw that the computer had 5 SSDs, each one with 10TB of space.<br />
Her eyes shined bright seeing that, because she only had 500GB of HD in her computer.<br />
She switched to Steam and told her to download all the games she had.<br />
Then Lisa opened the Mega website, she logged into her account and downloaded the app, she installed it and put it to download all of her 2TB of files.<br />
She was loving that, setting up and organizing her new space of work.<br />
After letting Steam and Mega do their jobs, Lisa was a little hungry, she got closer to the fridge, and a screen that was attached to it lighted up.<br />
It showed a lot of text, like if it was a tutorial on how to use the fridge, Lisa thought it was pretty intuitive.<br />
She learned how to use the fridge, she thought about pizza, then opened the fridge, and a slice of pizza was there.<br />
Lisa thought it was amazing, she closed the fridge, thought about a coca-cola and opened the fridge.<br />
A can of coca cola was there, she grabbed it and closed the fridge.<br />
She came back to the computer table and laid the pizza and can in the top of the table.<br />
Lisa started organizing her Mega files, she liked to make websites, she had a website were she made a history of what she watched.<br />
She downloaded some anime on a website called SuperAnimes, Lisa had downloaded the first episode of the anime "Eromanga Sensei".<br />
Lisa thought it was interesting, and wanted to give it a try.<br />
She started watching it while eating the pizza and drinking the coca cola, she loved doing that.<br />
Lisa added the episode to her watch history and to her AniCartoMovie.txt file, she cleaned her hands and her mouth.<br />
Then she realized she forgot something, "Discord!, I forgot it", she thought, Lisa downloaded Discord and logged in her account.<br />
She was so happy to download it again, and use it again, she thought that was a dream.<br />
Lisa knew that Google+ was going to die soon, she was sad about that, but she was happy about starting that new but not so new life of hers.<br />
She had a special friend on Google+, that friend was called Funkysnipa Cat or Izaque in real life.<br />
She loved to talk with that friend, she opened Hangouts and asked for his Discord name and id.<br />
Izaque gave it to her, she added him on Discord and they started talking, Lisa wanted to know him more.<br />
They talked a lot, and knew a lot more about each other, Lisa was happy talking with Izaque.<br />
Lisa wanted to express herself better, and write something, she wanted to write words in her computer.<br />
Then she talked with Izaque about that, Izaque suggested for Lisa to start writing stories.<br />
She liked the idea, Izaque said for Lisa to download Notepad++, he said that its a good program for writing.<br />
Lisa downloaded the program and started her first draft of a story, she wrote for some minutes.<br />
She liked the result, then saved the file and sent it to her Mega cloud.<br />
Izaque said for her to post her story on Wattpad, because it was a good platform for writers.<br />
Lisa created an account there and posted her story, the name of the story was "The Odds of Nature".<br />
After waiting some time Lisa reloaded the page and there were 10 views in it, and a comment.<br />
The author of the comment was "stake2", Lisa switched to Discord and asked if Izaque had a Wattpad account.<br />
Izaque said yes, Lisa came back to Firefox to read the comment, stake2 was complimenting the story of Lisa, she was happy about that.<br />
She liked the comment and replied thanking stake2, she was really happy about that comment.<br />
Then Lisa switched to Discord and asked for the link of the account of Izaque on Wattpad.<br />
Izaque sent the link to Lisa, surprisingly was stake2, Lisa was really happy about that.<br />
She switched to Discord to thank Izaque for that, Lisa said she loved to write the first chapter.<br />
Izaque said: "I started like that, well, I wrote Ilha Deserta, I wasn't really happy about that story, it was my first story."<br />
Then Izaque said: "I made Ilha Deserta in 2016, when I was reading a really cool futuristic story, I was happy about the feeling that writing gave me,<br />
then I never stopped till today."<br />
Lisa said: "Oh, I'm happy to know that, I love to write, I will read your story called "Life of Littletato", I liked to know how your started writing,<br />
thanks for teaching me a lot about writing."<br />
Then Izaque said: "I don't know much, but thanks for listening, learning and saying that my knowledge was helpful :), hehe, I like you a lot Lisa :3."<br />
Lisa said: "I like you a lot too Izaque, hehe :3."<br />
Then Steam finished downloading all the games of Lisa, she wanted to play one, she opened Grand Theft Auto 5 to play a little.<br />
She had some mods installed, she loved to play that game, to drive cars and stuff.<br />
Lisa played a little and stopped, she closed the game, she was hungry again, she got up and thought about a hamburger and a coca cola.<br />
She opened the fridge and there was, a hamburger in a plate and a can of coca cola. <br />
Lisa downloaded an episode of the sixth season of the series "The Walking Dead", she waited for it to be downloaded and opened it in VLC Media Player.<br />
She thought was weird to eat while watching that series, but she couldn't handle her hunger, so she watched while eating.<br />
It was sad to watch that series, sometimes people die, and you end the episode being sad.<br />
She finished watching and eating, she added the episode to her watch history.<br />
She felt tired, and she wanted to use the bathroom, she used it and came to her bed, she laid on her bed and tried to close her eyes.<br />
Lisa thought: "This is really a dream?, it looks very real...", then Lisa tries to pinch herself.<br />
She didn't woke up, she was surprised by that.<br />
Then Lisa slept, waiting to go more at the computer.<br />

﻿[In the last chapter, Lisa was not dreaming, she actually teleported to the SpaceShip, it wasn't a dream]<br />
Another day in the SpaceLiving world, a rumor about a group spaceship was circulating, 4 friends who were so close and knew each other so well.<br />
They were teleported to the spaceship together, this rumor was spreading quickly, the users of the LonelyShips were talking a lot about it.<br />
They created theories and groups, fake Discord accounts about it.<br />
There was also a story, created and written by a user on Discord and Wattpad, called stake2.<br />
It was about the actions and the life of that specific group in their LonelyShip.<br />
The name of the group was... Gang Da Suruba.<br />
Some people thought that stake2 was a resident on the spaceship of Gang Da Suruba(GDS) because the story had many details.<br />
At some time, in 2019 or 2020, I think.<br />
4 friends sent messages in the official SpaceLiving Discord Server.<br />
Their names were Drag, Manuh, Funkysnipa Cat and kendrinhah.<br />
One of the members sent a selfie of the group, it was Manuh.<br />
Manuh and Drag were fighting in the back of the picture.<br />
Kendra was taking the picture and Funkysnipa Cat was just headbanging to dubstep in the bed.<br />
The users that were looking at the chat started to talk about it.<br />
One said: "They are the rare group that was teleported to a LonelyShip!".<br />
John was there too, he said: "Oh, I would like to live in a spaceship with my friends".<br />
Funkysnipa Cat said: "And that is me, headbanging to dubstep in the bed".<br />
Drag said: "I'm fighting in the back of the pic with Manuh".<br />
kendrinhah said: "And I'm taking the pic".<br />
A random user said: "This is the first pic of a spaceship, we never saw a picture of a LonelyShip".<br />
Ted said: "Yea, that's right, someone gotta tell ThinkOutsideTheBox".<br />
A SpaceLiving Admin said: "They already know about that, since they have enabled that feature, only for that specific group,<br />
So they should feel special".<br />
Ted said: "Oh, okay then, they should feel happy".<br />
The Admin said: "Yea...".<br />
After some time people stopped talking about them, a member of the group began to stream on Twitch.<br />
Showing his things, how he wrote stories, and surprisingly, Funkysnipa Cat was also stake2.<br />
And the story was real, the story was about the group of Gang Da Suruba.<br />
The people watching asked a lot of questions to stake2, what was his name, he replied that his name was Izaque.<br />
Manuh, Drag, and Kendra entered the room of Izaque, one at a time, to present themselves for Izaque's viewers.<br />
After a while Izaque closed the live stream, he wanted to sleep a little, he closed the door and laid on his bed.<br />
Kendra was sleeping too, Izaque dreamed a little, thinking that he loved to live there with his friends.<br />
On the next day, Izaque woke up and opened his door, he turned on his computer and saw an announcement on the Official SpaceLiving Discord Server.<br />
It was a notification saying that on that day, at 18:00 all LonelyShippers or LonelyShip residents were going to be teleported to a big SpaceShip.<br />
To make a party, also because of that specific event (the GDS group), for the LonelyShippers to know other LonelyShippers.<br />
Izaque told Drag, Kendra, and Manuh about that, Manuh said in Brazilian Portuguese:<br />
"Mas eles não podem simplesmente nos teleportar pra lá, e se alguém não quiser ir?".<br />
("But they can't just simply teleport us to there, and if there's someone who doesn't want to go?").<br />
Izaque said in Brazilian Portuguese: "Bom... eles fizeram isso pra nós trazer pra cá kk".<br />
("Well... they made that to bring us here xD").<br />
Manuh replied: "Até que faz sentido" ("Well that makes sense").<br />
After some time, it was 18:00, the LonelyShippers looked at their computer clocks, they suddenly were floating, then all of them appeared on a single spaceship.<br />
Everyone looked at each other, Ted was close to Monika, John smiled at Lisa and Lisa smiled back, Izaque hugged Lisa and Lisa accepted the hug.<br />
Kendra was a little jealous because of that, Izaque then smiled at Wendy and Wendy smiled back.<br />
Manuh told Kendra that if she was her, she would get mad at Wendy and Lisa.<br />
Kendra thought she was not that angry or wasn't so extreme as Manuh.<br />
Izaque talked a little with Lisa, Wendy, John, Ted, Monika, he loved to talk face to face with people he talked through the internet.<br />
Wendy and Lisa were so happy about that, everyone was chatting, it was an awesome sight, a lot of people with lots of stuff in common.<br />
Talking a lot and being in the same environment.<br />
Then a screen appeared in the spaceship, saying:<br />
<i>"This was a meeting planned for some days in the future, but it has been done today because we felt like doing it today.<br />
We, at ThinkOutsideTheBox, want to thank all of you, and we want to say that we are so happy to have you here today.<br />
Everyone who participated, everyone who lives inside a LonelyShip, everyone that lives inside a DoubleLonelyShip.<br />
And some specific people... that live inside a... Group SpaceShip :), everyone is important.<br />
And to know that we created those things, those spaceships called LonelyShips, to make people happy.<br />
To make a good thing, the spaceships are lonely, but you're all here now, talking with each other, meeting new people and making friends.<br />
We are also commemorating here, commemorating... 2 years of the SpaceLiving Network, we are so happy to see all of your faces.<br />
And we are happy knowing that we made you people happy, and probably not lonely today, we are happy to give life to your thoughts.<br />
We are happy and proud to make your wishes a reality, and to provide the possibility of living how you want.<br />
We are so happy to write, to live and to create things for the people that want them, so, thank you all.<br />
Everyone who read the story too, Izaque, or stake2 or Funkysnipa Cat, you're a good guy, and a smart guy.<br />
Thanks for being in our LonelyShip and thanks for being yourself and thanks for existing, xD.<br />
Thanks for everything, and we will continue to live like this, and the SpaceShips will continue to exist.<br />
Also... protect yourself from the asteroids, dubstep is good, and be lonely! (well that's a weird thing to say after what happened today)".</i><br />
The screen disappears, a button to teleport back to your SpaceShip appears, Izaque, Wendy and Lisa keep talking there.<br />
Kendra, Drag, Ted, Monika, and John teleport back to their spaceships.<br />
"Não demora muito Stake" (Don't take too long Stake), says Manuh, who teleports back to her spaceship.<br />
After some time, Lisa teleports back to her spaceship, Izaque, and Wendy talks a little about the anniversary.<br />
"It was good right?", says Wendy.<br />
"Yea, it was pretty awesome, seeing everyone and stuff", says Izaque.<br />
They both teleport back to their spaceships.<br />
Izaque was a little tired, he watched an episode of the second season of One Punch Man and laid on his bed.<br />
He slept.<br />
Wendy was practicing on her keyboard, she thought she learned a lot since the last time she played.<br />
Manuh was sleeping already, Kendra was sleeping too, she was dreaming about No Man's Sky or a Synthwave world.<br />
Drag was listening to some kpop on his smartphone.<br />
Lisa was writing a little, The Odds Of Nature again ("She loves to write that story", says the *Writer*).<br />
Ted and Monika were watching a romance movie, they loved to watch it together.<br />
John was finishing the newest chapter of one of his stories [Me too, ah, stop breaking the fourth wall...].<br />
Everyone was happy in the SpaceLiving Network, living their lives, doing their stuff, doing what they love.<br />
It was a good day for SpaceLiving.<br />

It was a beautiful day in the SpaceLiving world.<br />
Lisa, Izaque, Wendy, John, Ted, Monika, Manuh, Kendra, and Drag were all inside their spaceships, living happily.<br />
Izaque was looking for "New World Things" on the Internet and Discord Servers.<br />
He was a SpaceLiver or a resident of the LonelyShips but also liked to do "New World Stuff" in the earth.<br />
Izaque learned about this New World Theory in 2016, it was about a group of people that were changing the whole world.<br />
With holograms, soul-like body forms, beings, laws, he made the documentation of New World and a website for it in 2019, before being teleported to a LonelyShip.<br />
And sometimes, he teleports out of his spaceship, to do those New World stuff, to use holograms, to see his loved characters of his favorite cartoon.<br />
Which is My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, Izaque dreamed his entire life about being able to see them, to hug them, to talk to them.<br />
The first time he saw them, with the possibility that New World has created for him, was two months before he was teleported to his LonelyShip, he hugged every one of them.<br />
Twilight Sparkle, Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, Rarity, and Applejack.<br />
He was so happy at that moment, he could cry of happiness all day.<br />
New World and the New World Government have created a portal to all the visual things that humans have created, movies, cartoons, anime, games, series.<br />
Izaque loved to visit and talk with all his favorite characters, of MLP, Sword Art Online, Fairy Tail, To Love Ru, Shingeki No Kyojin, Yuru Camp, Plastic Memories, Eromanga Sensei.<br />
He had a lot of New World friends, who knew about New World its technology.<br />
Izaque was tired, he said for some Discord friends that he was going to take a nap, he looked at the computer clock and perceived that it was 12:00 in the afternoon.<br />
He said good afternoon to Wendy, Lulu, Igor, Carol, Paulo, Camila, and Natalia, then he turned off the computer and laid on his bed.<br />
Izaque was dreaming, he was a kid in that dream, a kid named Izaque, and he was eating dinner with Lulu, his sister, Ana, his mother, John, his father.<br />
He loved his family, Izaque loved to go out on adventures with Lulu and John, in one specific adventure, Izaque got a Gold Glove with jewels in it, he thinks the last user of this glove was sonahT.<br />
Izaque loved to use his glove, to protect his family, the glove had the power to create portals, to travel to another dimension, and to fire elements.<br />
One night, everyone except Izaque was sleeping, he grabbed his glove and got out of the house, then opened a portal to the My Little Pony World.<br />
It was his first time in another world, he transformed his glove into two normal, black gloves, and made himself invisible.<br />
He looked and analyzed the creatures of that world, they were ponies, then Izaque imagined himself like a pony, he transformed into one with a green mane, blue skin and became visible.<br />
A pink pony approached him, he was scared, because he didn't want to draw too much attention or make a commotion.<br />
The pink pony said in a sharp, shrill voice: "I've never seen you here in Ponyville, are you new?, <br />
my name is Pinkie Pie and I am the receptionist, party planner, and cupcakes cooker of town, what's your name?."<br />
Izaque was scared and surprised about how that pony could talk so fast, it was hard for him to understand all those words in so little time.<br />
He replied: "Uh... my name is Izaque and yes, I'm new here, I don't want to live here, you know... I'm just a visitor, can I talk to...".<br />
At that moment, Izaque moved his right hoof to his back and used the hidden glove to know a little about the universe.<br />
It looked like he was stealing or copying the knowledge that the Izaque of Planet Earth in 2019 had about the My Little Pony universe.<br />
"Twilight Sparkle?", said him, finishing his sentence.<br />
Pinkie Pie said: "Oh, you wanna meet my friend Twilight right?, I'll take you to her".<br />
"Thanks a lot!", replied Izaque.<br />
They both walked to the Friendship Castle and Pinkie Pie knocked on the door.<br />
Twilight opened the door and said: "Oh hey Pinkie Pie", then turned her head to Izaque and said while getting close to his face:<br />
"Hey... I think I know you, you have an aura of someone I know... can I look at you more closely?".<br />
Izaque blushed and said: "W-well, maybe, hehe...".<br />
Pinkie Pie said: "Well... I'm gonna leave you guys alone", and started walking away from them.<br />
"Good!", said Twilight.<br />
Then she began to mumble while analyzing him, "You remind me of Izaque... a human that comes here sometimes", said her.<br />
"I fear you're a version of him from another universe, what are you doing here, and why are you a pony? how did you get here?".<br />
Izaque said: "Well... I just wanted to visit this world, I'm a pony because I have a magician item, I got here by that same magician item".<br />
Then he thought to himself: "Man, I have to go back, I learned through the Izaque of 2019 that one day in this world is one year at my world, I hope that's a myth".<br />
Twilight said: "Oh... and what magician item is that?".<br />
"Can I go in? I can't show that in public", whispered Izaque.<br />
Twilight said: "Sure!, come in", Izaque walked in and Twilight closed the door.<br />
"It's this thing here", said Izaque, while transforming his glove back to its original state.<br />
Twilight's eyes shined when she saw the beautiful, sheeny gold glove with jewels, she wanted to touch it.<br />
She moved her hoof close to the glove, Izaque moved the glove closer to him and said: "I gotta go Twilight, sorry, I'm gonna leave this... stone here, so you can remember that I'm gonna come back".<br />
"Oh, okay...", said Twilight, then Izaque created a small rock with the letter "I" on it and dropped it on the floor, opened a portal back to his world and crossed through it.<br />
He was back at his world, he came inside the house and walked to his room, stored his glove on a wooden chest and slept again.<br />
Before sleeping, Izaque thought: "I said I was going to travel to other worlds, Lulu of Planet Earth!".<br />
Then the dream of Izaque changed to something else, he was dreaming about a game called No Man's Sky.<br />
Wendy was in her spaceship, she perceived that she loved the bird Phoenix, and wanted to have one, she asked herself if she could create one in the spaceship.<br />
Then a voice started speaking in the spaceship, it said: "Do you want to have a pet in your spaceship?, then click on this button and the Pets menu will open on your computer".<br />
"If you had a pet in the earth, it would be brought together with you, but it seems that you don't have one, so get one at the menu".<br />
Wendy pressed the button and the menu opened in the SpaceLiving app that was installed in her computer, she then selected the Phoenix.<br />
The menu lets her choose only the name of the pet, she chose one and clicked on the "Spawn" button.<br />
A Phoenix appeared in her spaceship, the animal was a female, her name was "Philomena".<br />
The bird was an ugly bird, Wendy didn't like that, but then, the bird exploded in flames and became ashes.<br />
After some time, the ashes shine and a beautiful, yellow and red bird is born, shining more than the sun, Wendy got amazed by that.<br />
Philomena flew to Wendy's arm and she smiled, "I love you... Philomena...", said Wendy.<br />
Then after some time, an open birdcage and a nest appeared on the wall, it had bird food and water, a voice on the spaceship said:<br />
"The spaceship automatically detects if the pet needs food or water, if the pet drinks or eats all the food, the space ship will put more in there".<br />
"And the spaceship has a special place for each type of animal, so they can do their necessities, every time the pet thinks about doing that, the spaceship will release a scent".<br />
"A scent that makes the pet want to go to that special place, your pet will be in good hands, or more like... mechanical arms and pistons, thanks for getting a pet, take care of it!".<br />
Wendy was a little tired, she played some piano, Philomena danced to the music that she was playing, Wendy was happy about that.<br />
She got tired and laid on her bed, slept and had a good dream, a happy dream, where she was with her friends and had Philomena with her.<br />
Izaque was still dreaming about No Man's Sky, he was talking with a friend of him, a Korvax.<br />
John was writing one of his stories on his computer, he wanted to finish that chapter quickly because he was sleepy and tired.<br />
He finished the chapter and sent it to Lisa, she liked the chapter and told him to post it, he posted and received a lot of comments.<br />
John was too tired to reply to them all, he ate two chocolate crackers and drank a cup of water, then laid on his bed and slept.<br />
Every one at SpaceLiving was sleeping, it was 23:00 there, Ted was sleeping together with Monika.<br />
They always sleep hugged, Ted was dreaming about being the character of the survival game Don't Starve, the character was Wilson.<br />
He walked a little at the grassland, and gathered some grass and sticks, then made a campfire with rocks.<br />
After that, he took some trees down and put five logs into the campfire, cooked a pork-chop and ate it.<br />
Then he walked a little far to check some traps that he had made to catch some rabbits, three of them had rabbits trapped inside them.<br />
John picked up the traps and killed all the bunnies, then walked back to his campfire and cooked the three rabbits and stored them in his fridge.<br />
Monika was dreaming of being a computer file, she was inside a game, in that game, there were five characters, her, Sayori, Yuri, Natsuki, and Izaque, or the main character.<br />
She thought that the dream was really weird, it seemed too real, she knew that it was a game.<br />
A video was becoming famous at the Internet, it was a video that Izaque posted, he recorded his LonelyShip and made a tour through it.<br />
He showed his powerful computer, his ThoughtPoweredFridge(TPF), how it worked, how the buttons of the spaceship worked, what the windows showed.<br />
Izaque said it was a beautiful spaceship, with white walls, he said he loved to live there with Manuh, Drag, and Kendra.<br />
Lisa was listening to some synth-pop songs she had downloaded, she wanted to talk a little with Izaque.<br />
Izaque woke up, he needed some coffee, he got out of bed and opened the fridge, his beautiful, quadrangular, green cup was there, with some coffee with milk.<br />
It was hot, and the smell was amazing, the color, 20% milk, and 80% coffee, the milk was poured first, just like he liked.<br />
He surely loved that cup, it was his favorite cup at the earth, then he turned on his computer and played whatever he was listening to the last time he used the computer.<br />
It was a rock song, the volume was so high that he spilled coffee on the table and on the floor, "Shit!", shouted him.<br />
He paused the song quickly, left the cup on the table and picked up a napkin to wipe the table, then cleaned the table and changed his clothes.<br />
Izaque listened to a calm song while drinking his coffee and checking his social media, the name of the song was "<a href="https://soundcloud.com/officialpandaeyes/panda-eyes-take-my-hand-ft-azuria-sky-zne-remix" class="w3-text-white">Panda Eyes - Take My Hand Ft. Azuria Sky (Z∆NE Remix)</a>".<br />
Some people liked and commented on his stories in Wattpad, he replied to all of them, thanking his fans, then replied to his messages on Facebook and Discord.<br />
He loved to know that Wendy, Lulu, Paulo, and Igor had talked to him, he was so happy to see them every day, even if it wasn't physically.<br />
For him, was awesome to see their faces, or profile pictures every day.<br />
Kendra woke up and wanted to eat something sweet, she got up and grabbed a marshmallow that was inside the fridge.<br />
She ate it and loved it, then she wanted to listen to some rock on her computer, she put it to play.<br />
Kendra was just like Izaque, headbanging to rock just like he headbangs to Dubstep.<br />
Manuh and Drag were still sleeping, they were dreaming about a lot of things, Drag dreamed about visiting some k-pop artists.<br />
Then about playing a game in his smartphone, Free Fire, he liked to play that game.<br />
Manuh dreamed about living with Brendon Urie from the band Panic! at the Disco, she loved him.<br />
Wendy was dreaming about playing the piano, she thought about a good video that she saw one day, about a cover of Bad Guy from Billie Eilish.<br />
She liked that video, and sent it to a special friend of her, her friend like the video and thanked her.<br />
Monika was dreaming about living in the No Man's Sky world, those SpaceLivers(LonelyShippers) surely dream right? (informal: man they don't stop dreaming xDD)<br />

Lisa was sitting in her chair while looking at the computer screen, a notification got her attention.<br />
Someone asked to add her as a friend in Discord, it was someone called Littletato, she looked cute in the picture, Lisa accepted her friend request.<br />
They began to chat:<br />
Lisa: "Hello... do you added me from the SpaceLiving server right?".<br />
Littletato: "Yea... I've met some cool people there, and I thought you looked cool and gentle xD, I'm annoying you in some way?".<br />
Lisa: "Of course not!, I love to talk to new people ^^, you're a SpaceLiver right?, or a LonelyShipper".<br />
Littletato: "Yes, I guess I could be called that way xD, I was just scrolling Facebook at my computer and began floating and a light blue light surrounded my body, I didn't know what was happening, I was very scared...".<br />
Lisa: "Oh... that is one of the rumors that I been hearing, I think it was called Random-Teleport, it isn't the standard procedure for teleporting someone to a SpaceShip, I feel sorry for you...".<br />
Littletato: "Hm, thanks for explaining that to me, I already ate a slice of pizza an watched an anime called Eromanga Sensei, that is enough to be considered a SpaceLiver? xD".<br />
Lisa: "Maybe xD, actually, to be considered a SpaceLiver you have to be teleported to a SpaceLiving ship, there are a lot of cool things to do".<br />
Lisa: "Also... Eromanga Sensei?, I love that anime!, in fact, I look a little like the main character, Sagiri, here... I'll send a pic of me...".<br />
<a href="https://diario.netlify.com/cdn/img/Lisa.jpg"><img src="https://diario.netlify.com/cdn/img/Lisa.jpg" width="20%" style="float:left;border-width:4px;border-color:black;border-style:solid;" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
Littletato: "Oh... you're cute xD, and you look like her! :3, I'll send a photo of me... don't look too much, I'm shy... :3".<br />
(Narrator-Izaque: Julia will get mad Littletato... don't send pics to her xD)<br />
<a href="https://diario.netlify.com/cdn/img/human pequenata.jpg"><img src="https://diario.netlify.com/cdn/img/human pequenata.jpg" width="20%" style="float:left;border-width:4px;border-color:black;border-style:solid;" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
Lisa: "Y-You're cute too! :3, hehe, I like your hair, I wanted to have that color, also... it is raining where your SpaceShip is located?, I've never seen a cloud near my spaceship before, this is weird...".<br />
Littletato: "Really? there are no clouds in here, how clouds can exist here if we are living in space xD".<br />
Lisa: "I don't know xD, hey, do you wanna meet some of my friends?".<br />
Littletato: "Um... sure, if they're as cool as you xD".<br />
Lisa: "Well, here's the discord tag of my friend Izaque, he is very cool, also, do you wanna read my stories?, Izaque writes too xD".<br />
Littletato: "I'm gonna add him, send me the link or file you would like me to read, I would love to read something made by you".<br />
Then Littletato asked for the friend request of Izaque and opened the story page of "The Odds of Nature", the story that Lisa had sent to her.<br />
Littletato began chatting with Izaque:<br />
Littletato: "Hello Izaque... Lisa sent me your discord tag so I added you on here, thanks for accepting the friend request, so... do you write stories? UwU".<br />
Izaque: "Well, I'm writing you right now... I-I mean, I'm writing something right now, but you can talk with me :3, I think Lisa didn't tell me that you were going to add me".<br />
Littletato: "Maybe you gotta talk with her about that, also, what you're writing?, I was watching Eromanga Sensei, I told that to Lisa and she told me that she looks like the main character, Sagiri".<br />
Littletato: "She sent me a pic of her... she's very cute, but you already know that right? you guys look to be very close friends...".<br />
Izaque: "Yea, well, actually, she never sent me a pic of her '-'... I'm gonna ask for her to send me a pic xD".<br />
Littletato: "That is weird xD... but probably she would send one to you, I-I...".<br />
Izaque: "What?, I'm not gonna judge you... don't need to worry".<br />
Littletato: "It's not that... I mean, I was teleported here by mistake, I was just minding my own business at my computer and I began floating and a light blue light surrounded me, then I was taken to this spaceship".<br />
Izaque: "So the rumors were true... the Random-Teleport, well, they said that you can go back, right? at least that's what the rumor says...".<br />
Littletato: "Yea, they said that I could right-click the tray icon and select [Teleport back to Earth], maybe it's a glitch or something, and the system called the wrong person?".<br />
Izaque: "Yea, I guess it's that, have you tried clicking that button? probably they will ask for a confirmation, don't worry".<br />
After that, Littletato right-clicked the tray icon and selected [Teleport back to Earth], a message prompted her confirmation saying "Do you really want to teleport back to Earth?".<br />
Littletato came back to the Discord window and sent a message to Izaque saying:<br />
"Yea... you're right, looks like it works, and it asked me for a confirmation...".<br />
Izaque: "Oh, that's cool, I hope you can get back on earth if you really want to, can I send you one of my stories?".<br />
Littletato: "Yes!, I would love to read something made by you ❤️...".<br />
Izaque: "Okay, I'll send it, I'll also add you to the Readers list :3".<br />
Then Izaque sent Littletato a link to his story, Clone Network.<br />
Littletato: "I'm so happy to be on that list! :3".<br />
Izaque: "Thanks for the love and support Littletato, I'm really happy I met you :3 ❤️".<br />
Littletato: "I think I'm gonna finish reading one chapter of The Odds Of Nature and Clone Network, thanks for sending me the link".<br />
Izaque: "Oh, the story of Lisa xD, she has a lot of talent for writing".<br />
Littletato: "I agree with you, makes me feel inside the story".<br />
Izaque: "I feel the same way xD, I think I'm gonna watch something from my To Watch list, Littletato, can I ask you something?".<br />
Littletato: "Yes?...".<br />
Izaque: "C-Can you send me a picture of you?...".<br />
Izaque: "Sorry, I shouldn't have asked that...".<br />
Littletato: "Okay, here it is, it's the same I sent to Lisa".<br />
<a href="https://diario.netlify.com/cdn/img/human pequenata.jpg"><img src="https://diario.netlify.com/cdn/img/human pequenata.jpg" width="20%" style="float:left;border-width:4px;border-color:black;border-style:solid;" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
Izaque: "Really?... you're really cute! :3... hehe, you have beautiful eyes...".<br />
Littletato: "Thanks Izaque! :3 ^w^, can you send me one of you too?, I am shy and embarrassed now...".<br />
Izaque: "Oh, sorry, I forgot!".<br />
(Well, guess I can't put that pic here xD, reader, I'm shy, sorry, please ask for my discord tag on my twitter profile if you really wanna see my face)<br />
Littletato: "You're so cuuuute! :3, I'm blushing so much right now, sorry".<br />
Izaque: "It's ok xD, thanks, you're also cute Pequenata, I mean, Littletato".<br />
Littletato: "How do you know that name?, some people call me Pequenata here in San Francisco, actually, *there* in San Francisco, I don't know why maybe it's the Brazilian version of the name...".<br />
Izaque: "I didn't know that, I mean, ah... I can't explain this... sorry".<br />
Littletato: "It's okay... I'm gonna read something, okay?, sorry if I don't reply too quickly :3".<br />
Izaque: "Okay :3, I'm a little busy here too xD".<br />
Littletato then began to read The Odds Of Nature, she read the story until the fifth chapter and stopped.<br />
After that, she read Clone Network and liked, she wanted to say that to Izaque and Lisa.<br />
Littletato opened her conversation with Izaque and said:<br />
"Hello... I loved your story Izaque!, I liked how you were making a lot of clones to make everything you want, that's a really good thought and an awesome idea xD".<br />
Izaque: "Oh, thanks for the feedback Littletato :3, I'm glad you loved it because I sure loved to write that story...".<br />
Izaque: "Also, can you promise me something Tato?".<br />
Littletato: "Tato, I liked that name xD, what is it?".<br />
Izaque: "Can you promise me that you will tell me when you begin to teleport back to earth?".<br />
Littletato: "Yes... I'll make sure to tell you, I promise :3".<br />
Izaque: "Thanks...".<br />
Littletato: "You're welcome my dear friend".<br />
Then Izaque opened his conversation with Lisa to ask something:<br />
"Hey, Lisa...".<br />
Lisa: "Hello Izaque!, how are you? :3".<br />
Izaque: "Well, I'm good, did you sent my discord tag to Littletato without asking me?".<br />
Lisa: "Uh... yea... sorry Izaque, I'm gonna ask for your permission the next time, sorry...".<br />
Izaque: "It's okay, I'm not mad at you :3, but... Littletato said you sent a pic to her, and you never sent a pic to me '-'...".<br />
Lisa: "Aww my sweetie... I didn't send it because you didn't ask... here, I'll send one to you, and... you never sent me one pic too xD".<br />
Izaque: "Sorry, I'll send xD".<br />
<a href="https://diario.netlify.com/cdn/img/Lisa.jpg"><img src="https://diario.netlify.com/cdn/img/Lisa.jpg" width="20%" style="float:left;border-width:4px;border-color:black;border-style:solid;" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
(again, can't show my face here xD)<br />
Izaque: "You're so cuuuuute Lisa! :3, I love your green eyes and your cute grey hair :3".<br />
Lisa: "You're so cute tooo my love! :3, I love your fluffy hair and cute face, your nose is cute too :3 xD".<br />
Izaque: "Thanks Lisa xD, I'm blushing right now, thanks for so much love ❤️".<br />
Lisa: "You're welcome my love! ❤️".<br />
...<br />
Littletato was worried about Julia, she opened the menu to teleport back to Earth when she was ready to click on the button labeled "Yes!", she thought about Izaque and Lisa, her two dear friends.<br />
She thought about telling them goodbye.<br />
(Play this song and read this part while listening to it: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/officialpandaeyes/oppositeside" class="w3-text-white">https://soundcloud.com/officialpandaeyes/oppositeside</a> )<br />
Littletato opened the chat of Izaque and said.<br />
"Hello Izaque, I'm going back to earth now, it was good and fun to meet you, I was happy, maybe we'll see each other again soon... I hope you have a good day, or... night xD :3".<br />
Izaque: "It was fun to meet and talk with you too Littletato, I'll definitely write about you more, I mean, we'll definitely see each other again, maybe in chapter 50 of Pequenata, I mean, maybe soon! :3".<br />
Izaque: "Goodbye Littletato! :3".<br />
Littletato: "Goodbye Izaque! :3 :)".<br />
Then she talked to Lisa:<br />
"Hello Lisa, I'm going back to earth!, I hope we see each other again soon, I was happy while talking with you even if it was just for one day, thank you for that Lisa!".<br />
Lisa: "Oh, you're going now :), goodbye Littletato, I'm sure we'll see each other again, I was happy with you too! :3, thank you! :33".<br />
Littletato: "Tee hee! thanks, Lisa, goodbye :3".<br />

<b>Title: The Visit of Lisa</b><br /><br />
Wendy was playing some keyboard on her spaceship, it was the theme song of the Titanic movie, she liked to practice keyboard.<br />
Izaque was thinking about his days at school, he had a lot of friends there and liked talking to them every day, the food was not very good but he liked.<br />
Monika was talking to some of her friends on Discord, one friend of hers was called Sayori.<br />
Monika said: "hey Sayori, how are you?..."<br />
Sayori: "hey Monika, I'm fine, how about you?"<br />
Monika: "I'm good too, just living here in the spaceship with my boyfriend Ted"<br />
Sayori: "Oh, I got a part-time job with Yuri, it is on a library"<br />
Monika: "That sounds very sweet Sayori, good luck on your job! What about Yuri?"<br />
Sayori: "Well... she liked the job because she loves books, so I guess its a really good job for her"<br />
Ted was playing some Titanfall 2 with his friends, after that he changed to Terraria.<br />
Izaque got a notification on the Discord server of SpaceLiving saying that a new SpaceLiver has arrived.<br />
The message says: "@Funkysnipa Cat#1778 Hello, a new SpaceLiver has arrived!, it would be good if you could greet them and explain to them about the SpaceLiving Network, thanks for your help! :)"<br />
Izaque then added the new SpaceLiver on Discord, she was called Marina.<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Hello, I'm an admin at the SpaceLiving Discord server, they told me that you're new here, so... need help with anything? :)"<br />
Her user-name was Peach_Army, she said: "I wanted to know where I am, where all of this came from and who's the owner of this rabbit?"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat said: "Well... this spaceship is called "LonelyShip", she is hovering some kilometers away from earth, if you look through the window you will see the earth."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "This bunny was given to you because you had thought before coming here about having a bunny, and then the spaceship gave it to you."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Don't worry, if you want to go back home you can click on the icon on your computer and click on "Teleport back to earth..."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "The spaceship teleported you because it felt your desire, about living alone, only with a computer, food, a bathroom, this happened with me too, and with everyone at the server."<br />
Marina looked at the window and thought about the earth for a little, about everything she went through there, then she decides something and walks to the computer and types on the shiny keys.<br />
Peach_Army: "I want to stay."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Hm, I'm happy for you, I can assure you will be so much happy here, I hope I have helped you, we can be friends?... my name is Izaque."<br />
Peach_Army: "Well, if I'm gonna stay alone here with... the bunny, then yes, we can be friends."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Oh that's good, I'm glad, what's your name?"<br />
Peach_Army: "My name is Marina, nice to meet you."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Nice to meet you too Marina."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "So... what do you like to do on the computer? :D"<br />
Marina: "I try to compose songs, play some games of strategy and talk a little"<br />
Marina: "I also see doramas"<br />
Marina: "and study"<br />
Marina: "How about you?"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Well, I watch anime, write some stories, talk with some friends here on Discord, help the new people who arrive, I love to play too, on Xbox One, PS4"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "And studying was one of the boring things that I did in my life on earth xD, why do you study? or what you study?"<br />
Marina: "Actually, studying was one of the things I loved the most on Earth"<br />
Marina: "I like to know that what I learn will always innovate"<br />
Marina: "I must have been one of the only people who like math"<br />
Marina: "xD"<br />
Marina: "And I study Asian culture"<br />
Marina: "Mostly the Korean"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "lol, I think I can drop the "first capital letter" and use period, they say I can't be friends with the people I help get to SpaceLiving"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "I think I didn't like to learn what I wouldn't use like history, Brazilian Portuguese, or the things of the school, but I love to learn about technology"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "I love Japanese culture"<br />
Marina: "One of my favorites too lol"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "hahaha"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "I love to show this New World to people, because I love to live in it, the SpaceLiving, but I don't like the rules, like the one I told you about"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "do you know the name of the company that created the SpaceLiving Network?"<br />
Marina: "no.."<br />
Marina: "Which one?"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Its ThinkOutsideTheBox or TOTB"<br />
Marina: "How the families of the people of SpaceLiving feel like?"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "I think they get sad, but some don't care, because they don't care about the relative, they receive a message like a hologram, telling that their relative of them is on a SpaceLiving"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "you can eat what you want on the fridge, but your relatives can send special food for you if they want, just let them know"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "like food from your grandma or mom that you love"<br />
Marina: "I see..."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "there's also a teleporter on the spaceship that can teleport you to a house that you consider trustworthy like your parents' house to visit if you miss them"<br />
Marina: "I was going to ask that now xD"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "xD"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "just go there and think "my dad's house" "my mom's house" or something, and click a button called "Submit" "<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "the person who lives in the house of your choice will receive the notification and will choose to accept or not, then a teleporter will be created in the chosen house"<br />
Marina: "Got it..."<br />
Marina: "I think I'll like it here"<br />
Marina: "It seems my dream has finally come true, without the problems of others surrounding me"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "That's very good Marina, this was my dream too, and living alone too, I love computers"<br />
Marina: "My computer gave life to me xD"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "xD"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "I think there's a boy who writes stories about this spaceship"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Or his spaceship in this case, maybe this boy is me xD, just maybe..."<br />
Marina: "Really?!"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "yes Hahaha xD"<br />
Marina: "I'd love to read your story someday"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "I'd love to send it to you"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "there are already some chapters published"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "want the link?"<br />
Marina: "Yes, Please"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "<a href="https://diario.netlify.com/new_world/spaceliving/" class="w3-text-white">https://diario.netlify.com/new_world/spaceliving/</a>"<br />
Marina: "Thank you"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "you're welcome, thanks for reading"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "I think in chapter 5 there's an invite to the SpaceLiving server, but that's kind of useless since you're already on it"<br />
Marina: "So, who reads till Chapter 5, and is on Earth, can go to SpaceLiving?!"<br />
Marina: "If I had known I would have read your story before xDDD"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "xDD"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Well... no, I just send this story to someone that is already on a ship"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "But I think there are some internet tutorials on how to be "invited" to live on a SpaceLiving"<br />
Marina: "I've never seen anything about it"<br />
Marina: "I would have liked it a lot"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Me too"<br />
Marina: "I'll talk to you later, I'm gonna watch an anime here, see ya later :3"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "See you later Marina :3"<br />
Then Marina walked close to her TPF(Thought-Powered-Fridge) and thought about a coca-cola and a slice of pizza.<br />
She sat at her chair and laid the cup and plate on the top of the table, then downloaded an episode of the anime called Eromanga Sensei to watch.<br />
Marina ate the food and drank the soda while watching, she loved to watch anime while eating.<br />
After that, she was feeling a little tired, she said goodnight to Izaque and laid on her bed, then slept.<br />

<b>Title: The visit of Izaque</b><br /><br />
Izaque was in his LonelyShip, he was listening to a song of the Dubstep genre on Foobar2000, he thought about Marina, his special friend.<br />
He wanted to visit her somehow, or teleport to her LonelyShip, he messaged her on Discord, saying:<br />
"Hey Marina, can I teleport to your SpaceShip?... I wanted to visit you".<br />
She replied positively, then he opened the SpaceLiving Dashboard on his computer.<br />
A button popped up, it said:<br />
"Teleport to...".<br />
Then he clicked and typed the id of Marina's Discord alongside with her name.<br />
A message appeared on Marina's computer, saying:<br />
"Funkysnipa Cat#1778 wants to teleport to your LonelyShip, accept?".<br />
She clicked on yes, then the teleporter of Izaque began to shine blue, he walked inside it and closed the door.<br />
A blue light shines inside Marina's teleporter after it disappears Marina sees Izaque inside the teleporter.<br />
He gets out of it and says:<br />
"Hi Marina!", says Izaque.<br />
"Hi!", says Marina.<br />
"So... I guess it's been a while since I've seen a person... personally," says Izaque with a short laugh.<br />
"Yes," says Marina with a short laugh.<br />
"Can I sit on your bed?", asks Izaque.<br />
"Yes you can," she says, tapping the bed beside him, indicating that he should sit there.<br />
He sits on her bed and realizes that the coverlet of the bed is purple and is very beautiful, he starts looking at Marina's spaceship.<br />
She continues to fiddle with her laptop.<br />
He looks at Marina fidgeting with her laptop and has an idea.<br />
"Hey Marina, would you like to watch something with me? Like an anime? The spaceship has a computer too if you want, and a big screen," asks Izaque.<br />
"Okay... We can eat something while we watch," says Marina, who gets up and goes to the fridge, choosing some sweets.<br />
"Ok, thanks," says Izaque.<br />
"Can I go choosing the movie?" Asks Izaque.<br />
"Sure," answers Marina.<br />
"Okay," says Izaque.<br />
He grabs Marina's notebook, opens the SpaceLiving interface, activates the computer and large monitor, and uses the remote controller to pick a movie on the computer.<br />
It opens the SpaceFlix application on the computer, which has all sorts of things mankind has ever produced, anime, movies, series, doramas, videos.<br />
"What do you want to eat?" Asks Marina.<br />
"Hm... pizza, but without onion, and a coke," he says as he picks a specific Japanese dorama he knows Marina likes, called Meteor Garden.<br />
He selects the first episode and pauses waiting for Marina to get the food.<br />
She takes what he asks and for her, gets ice cream and some cookies.<br />
"I'm coming!" Says Marina.<br />
"Okay," he says smiling at Marina.<br />
She puts his pizza on a plate and takes it along with the Coke, "Here," she says smiling.<br />
"Thanks, Marina," he says, who then picks up his pizza and coke and settles into bed.<br />
She sits next to him and says:<br />
"What are you putting for us to watch?"<br />
"Meteor Garden, I think you like this drama, right?" He asks.<br />
"I love! Thank you!" she says, who smiles at him and looks at the screen.<br />
"You're welcome Marina," he smiles back at her, gets up, and picks up the computer's wireless mouse and keyboard.<br />
Izaque leaves the video in full screen and presses play, then sits back in bed to watch with Marina.<br />
Marina paid attention to every detail of the scenes while eating ice cream.<br />
He stared at the screen as he ate his piece of pizza and drank his coke.<br />
"Are you enjoying it?" She whispered now turning her attention to Izaque.<br />
"Yes, this drama is very cool, you have good taste Marina," he replies.<br />
"Thank you." She feels a slight flush on her cheeks and turns her attention to the screen.<br />
"You're welcome," Izaque smiles at Marina and turns her attention back to the screen.<br />
He thinks how cool it is to be able to live on a SpaceLiving spaceship and watch movies in high resolutions while eating delicious stuff, and he feels like it's been a long time since he had a physical connection with anyone.<br />
Izaque finishes his pizza and his coke, the episode is already halfway through.<br />
She eats some cookies, "Want?" She says offering him one.<br />
"Yes," he replies, taking a cookie and eating it.<br />
"It's nice to watch along with you Marina, I'm so happy," he says, smiling at her.<br />
"I enjoyed your company here Zaq!" She smiles back.<br />
"Thanks, I also enjoyed keeping you company," he replies.<br />
It was the end of the episode, Izaque's coke can was on his plate, and Marina's ice cream jar was on the floor.<br />
Izaque left Marina's computer screen on the desktop and stood up, taking his plate and her jar.<br />
"Thank you," she says.<br />
"You're welcome, hey Marina, I don't know if you know, but if you put your used cutlery, utensils and plates in the fridge, it'll get rid of them," he says, opening the fridge and placing the plate and jar inside as he explains.<br />
After that he opens the fridge and looks at Marina, she sees that the fridge is empty.<br />
"I didn't know, thanks for telling me," she says, who gives a short laugh.<br />
"So, I think I'll come back to my Marina spaceship, hey..." he says thoughtfully.<br />
"Go on," she says as she watches him closely.<br />
"Can I give you a hug before I go?" Asks Izaque.<br />
She smiles and gets up, approaching him and saying "Yes you can".<br />
Izaque hugs her and closes her eyes, enjoying the moment.<br />
"Thanks for keeping me company today, I wanted to see someone," she says as she hugs him tighter and then releases him, waving and saying, "See you."<br />
"You're welcome, see ya," says Izaque, who enters the teleporter, as he was a guest on Marina's spaceship, he can only teleport back to his spaceship.<br />
He closes the teleporter's door and pushes a blue button that says "Back to your spaceship." After a few seconds a blue light comes on inside the teleporter, he takes one last look at Marina and then disappears.<br />
Marina smiles at him before he disappears, and is pleased to see Izaque.<br />
Izaque goes back to his teleporter, opens the door and gets out of it, turns on his computer and opens Discord to talk to Marina.<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Hey Marina... thanks for today, it was really cool, I think I'll get some sleep".<br />
Marina: "Yes, I really enjoyed today. Goodnight Izaque."<br />
Then Izaque turns off his computer, lies in his bed and sleeps.<br />

<b>Title: Teleportation attempt, The dream</b><br /><br />
Izaque was on his spaceship, he was on his computer, listening to a song called The Brig - Mind Changer.<br />
He was thinking about Marina, her friend that also lives in a spaceship, he wanted to see her again, even though they had seen each other last night.<br />
Izaque was thinking of calling Lisa to visit his spaceship for a few hours, he opened Discord and talk to her.<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Hey Lisa, do you know about the new system of teleport between the SpaceShips?..."<br />
Lisa: "Yes, what's up?"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "I think you already know that I visited the spaceship of Marina, right?"<br />
Lisa: "Yea, I know about that, what you're trying to say?"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "I want to say is that I want you to visit my spaceship or me to visit yours..."<br />
Lisa: "Oh..."<br />
Lisa: "Well... I think so... I want to visit you..."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Oh... it'll be great... I think..."<br />
Lisa: "Yes... well, Izaque, I'm afraid of something..."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "What?..."<br />
Lisa: "Marina already visited your spaceship, and... I'm afraid you're gonna do things that I don't want... did you do something... naughty with her?..."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Of course not... I only watched a movie with her and we ate some things, then she came back to her spaceship, I wouldn't do anything like that with you if you didn't want..."<br />
Lisa: "Hm... ok... can you call me now?... like... do the thing that teleports me there?..."<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Hm... I'm sorry in advance, but I'm kinda busy now, can it be later?..."<br />
Izaque then looks at the clock of his computer, it says "00:20".<br />
Lisa: "Ah, that's okay, I'm kinda busy here too"<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Okay, see you later my bb, love you &lt;3"<br />
Lisa: "Love you Izaque &lt;3, see ya later"<br />
Then Izaque continues using his computer, he watches an episode of Dr. Stone, he loves that anime.<br />
Izaque feels tired, he wants to sleep, Izaque watches an episode of My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic while eating a chocolate cake and drinking a coca-cola.<br />
Then he lies in his bed and closes his eyes, he sleeps, thinking about Marina and Lisa.<br />
Izaque dreams about being a human in Equestria, he is Izaque, a human that has golden wings made of lava fluid, a hand-grappling hook also made of lava fluid.<br />
He is also a half-human half-dragon, he breathes fire and haves lava instead of the normal human gastric acid.<br />
Izaque opens a purple portal and appears inside the Crystal Castle of Twilight Sparkle, she sees him and he sees her, Izaque talks with her:<br />
"Hey Twilight Sparkle!, how are you?" he asks.<br />
"I'm good, and you Izaque?" she replies.<br />
"Me too, long time no see right?" he says.<br />
<br />
Then Twilight replies: "Yea, but you're here now, and I'm happy because of that".<br />
<br />
Then Izaque told Twilight that he was talking with a friend of him, a friend from a distant place,<br />
Izaque was sat in the blue and comfy carpet that Twilight had, she stopped reading her book to listen to him.<br />
<br />
"Her name is Littletato... I'm her creator, you know... I wrote this story in 2016, it was called Littletato too,<br />
it was so awesome and is still so awesome to write that, I felt incredible and happy" explains Izaque.<br />
<br />
"Oh... that is very great to hear Izaque!, I'm glad you're having so much fun writing it,<br />
2016 was a long time on Earth right? like... 365 days, you're inspiring me to write a story Izaque!, that makes me soooo happy" replies Twilight.<br />
<br />
Then Izaque says: "Yea, a very long time, well... today right now in Earth is the year of 2019,<br />
I'm glad you're inspired by me Twilight, that makes me so much happy!, I would love to teach you how to write something!" says him.<br />
<br />
"I would love that!, please teach me, Izaque-sensei(teacher)" replies Twilight.<br />
<br />
Then Twilight asks: "Soo... how do you spoke with her? was it good?".<br />
<br />
"Yes, it was pretty good, well, I think she saw the Littletato story on Wattpad and asked for my Discord id, I gave it to her then she added me,<br />
thanked me for everything that I did, even if what I did was just create a story, I'm thankful for meeting her, my creation, haha, that was weird", explains Izaque.<br />
<br />
"Oh, that is a pretty good way of meeting someone, even though I don't know what Discord is, is it a network work that Discord created or something?<br />
how can you two connect that way?, sometimes I can't understand Discord, ugh..." says Twilight.<br />
<br />
"Well, Twilight, it isn't the Discord of this land, you know, Discord is only the name for a social network that exists on Earth,<br />
a technology network where people can talk with each other, I also can't understand him, never..." replies Izaque.<br />
<br />
Izaque says: "I also love Sword Art Online a lot, it was a anime on Earth that was launched in 2013, it is an anime, and it was my first anime".<br />
Twilight Sparkle replies: "Wow!, I would love to watch it with you, I bet it is really good, I also have things like that, that reminds me of my childhood, oh, the wonderful books that I've read when I was younger",<br />
"It makes me happy just to think, Izaque... never forget the things that make you feel happy... I love you Izaque".<br />
Twilight hugs Izaque, he says:<br />
"I love you too Twilight...".<br />
After some time hugging Izaque says:<br />
"Hey Twilight, I gotta go home, I will visit you again okay?, I love you" after saying that, Izaque kisses the cheek of the purple pony princess.<br />
"I love you too Izaque, see you" after saying that, Twilight kisses the cheek of the winged human-dragon hybrid back.<br />
Izaque creates another purple portal and goes back to Earth, he closes the portal and turns his computer on.<br />
He opens Wattpad and starts writing Littletato, a story that he loves to write a lot, then he thinks about writing SpaceLiving, another good story that he loves.<br />
Izaque thinks about Duda, Marina, Igor, Isabella, Ana, Carol, Fab, Wendy, MelodyStar, all of his friends, he loves them a lot.<br />
Then he finishes writing the chapter, he names it 28 - The beautiful Life of Littletato &lt;3, he is so proud of writing that chapter because it makes him so happy.<br />
He thinks about his other story, SpaceLiving, he created it with a friend of him, Julia, it now haves 12 chapters, he loves writing it.<br />
The Izaque from the SpaceLiving universe which is the Izaque that is having this dream right now is feeling all of these things.<br />
He is feeling the emotions of the Earth-MLP Izaque, the New World Izaque, the Nazzevo Izaque, the Old World Earth Izaque.<br />
The SpaceLiving Izaque thinks all of that is weird, that dream.<br />
SpaceLiving Izaque feels and sees how it is to be in the skin of Earth Izaque, Earth Izaque is eating a pizza right now, while watching The Walking Dead.<br />
SpaceLiving Izaque wakes up and sits in his bed.<br />
He thinks and associates all of that information, he wonders who is the Earth Izaque, who is the New World Izaque, who is Isabella, Ana, Carol, Fab, MelodyStar.<br />
Izaque turns on his computer and opens Paint, the program that he uses to make pixel art and drawings even if he doesn't draw very often.<br />
He draws a pixel art of his SpaceShip, after some time he says and finishes it:<br />
<a href="https://diario.netlify.com/cdn/img/spaceship.png"><img src="https://diario.netlify.com/cdn/img/spaceship.png" class="mobileHide" width="66%" style="float:left;border-width:4px;border-color:black;border-style:solid;" /></a>
<div class="mobileHide"><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
<a href="https://diario.netlify.com/cdn/img/spaceship.png"><img src="https://diario.netlify.com/cdn/img/spaceship.png" class="mobileShow" width="100%" style="float:left;border-width:4px;border-color:#2196F3;border-style:solid;" /></a>
Izaque becomes very proud of that drawing, he even shares it with some friends of him on Discord, Marina likes it a lot, Lisa too.<br />
Izaque thinks about that story that he dreamed of, Littletato, he knows that he never wrote it, he only wrote Kezzakam and SpaceLiving, also SpaceLivingXGDS.<br />
He searches for it in Wattpad, he finds out that a user, stake2, wrote Littletato, and Izaque uses that name(stake2) through the entire internet, he thinks that is weird.<br />
Izaque wants to sleep again, he is hungry too, he eats a slice of pizza and drinks coke, he turns off his computer and lies in bed again, trying to rest.<br />
He wants to dream more too, to know about things of other universes, the universe of Earth Izaque, of New World Izaque, of Old World Izaque.<br />
Izaque thinks that the fact that a lot of other Izaques exist is weird.<br />
A visual list with texts appears in his mind, he thinks it is a dream, the list says:<br />
"Earth Izaque, New World Izaque, Old World Izaque, SpaceLiving Izaque, Dreamworld Izaque, Nazzevo Izaque, Kingdom of Arstotzka Izaque, 'A Perfect World' Izaque,<br />
Omnipotent Izaque, Nothingness Izaque, Clone Network Izaque, Ilha Deserta Izaque, Relaxing Sunny Days Izaque, Ascencion To Equestria Izaque".<br />
A weird list with a lot of Izaques, a lot of versions of him, a lot of universes, multi-verse.<br />
Izaque(SL) thought that all of that information was a lot to digest, his head hurts, he thinks he haves to be an omnipotent being to understand that.<br />
He is still dreaming, a good and calm dream appears and he can have a good rest now.<br />
An audio message starts playing on the spaceship of Marina, saying: "Marina, come to me... I've sent this message to you by the universe feature that is called...<br />
"'Personal-brain spaceship connector' I guess, well... my name is Jay, I'm a Raptier, I live inside a planet called 'Osiris' in the same galaxy that you're on right now,<br />
The Milky Way, come with me, my id is Jay#3394, I've left a device in your spaceship for you to travel to my planet, there's a lot of nature here, I think it will be good for you,<br />
You can just visit and can go back to your spaceship whenever you want, don't worry, you won't be in any danger, we're a tribe that searches for humans to know us, <br />
Because we're so mistreated and discriminated by humans, we need to be equal with humans, we don't wanna fight, please, visit us, thank you, Jay."<br />
Marina reads all of that, then lies on her bed, she sees the hand teleporter in the floor and thinks about going there at Osiris.<br />
She wonders if it will be good for her.<br />
Or if she will be in danger, she sleeps.<br />

<b>Title: The Visit of Lisa</b><br /><br />
(Words: 3,095)<br />
Lisa was on her spaceship laid on her bed, listening to a song on her computer, it was called <a href="https://soundcloud.com/teminite/teminite-rattlesnake" class="w3-text-white">Teminite & Evilwave - [Uprising #07] Rattlesnake</a>.<br />
She loved that song, it was Dubstep but felt cool and energetic like rock and metal, she liked Teminite a lot, she even had him in her computer's music library.<br />
The gray-haired girl looked through the window and imagined how it was to live there, in Earth, she wanted to come back and she had her teleporter to do that, but she was afraid and unsure.<br />
"What would be out there?", "What I have to do?", "Will I be in danger there?", those were the kind of questions that popped in her mind.<br />
She got off the bed, paused the music and opened Discord.<br />
Funkysnipa Cat (stake2, Izaque) was online, she wanted to talk with him and clicked on his chat, then began typing.<br />
Lisa: "Hey Izaque... do you ever thought about coming back to Earth?".<br />
Izaque: "Yes... actually a lot of times... but... I came back to Earth a lot of times, so I'm used to it, SpaceLiving is connected with the New World, so I have things of the New World to do".<br />
Lisa: "Oh, that's good I guess... sounds like you have a lot of fun outside of the spaceship right?".<br />
Izaque: "Yea, a lot, but I have fun here too, talking to SpaceLivers/LonelyShippers, I love to be inside this spaceship right now, hm... why are you asking me that, Lisa?".<br />
Lisa: "It's that I want to go back to Earth... but I'm scared that I'm not gonna fit in... like... I don't know how to talk to people personally, and I'm not sure if my old house will accept my teleport request...".<br />
Izaque: "Oh... well... hm... we never met personally... right?... I mean... both of us inside the same spaceship...".<br />
Lisa: "Yea... I would like to meet you personally...".<br />
Izaque: "Me too... but... you said you were afraid of... coming here in my spaceship... like... you said 'I'm afraid you're gonna do things that I don't want'...".<br />
Lisa: "Hm... yes... I'm a little afraid of that... sorry... it's nothing about you and I'm not afraid of you... don't worry... I love you, Izaque <3".<br />
Izaque: "Oh... I know, I love you too, Lisa <3, and I'm happy that you're not afraid of me... do you want to make a deal?".<br />
Lisa: "What deal?".<br />
Izaque: "Hm... I promise not to do anything that you don't want? okay?... and... you can tell me when you feel uncomfortable with me okay?...".<br />
Lisa: "Okay Izaque, thanks for that... I mean... asking that... It's a promise, right? :3".<br />
Izaque: "Yes, I promise, Lisa :3".<br />
Lisa: "Thanks Izaque ^^".<br />
Izaque: "No problem Lisa ^^".<br />
Then Lisa got up, walked to the front of the Teleporter, opened the door and came inside, she closed the door and selected the Discord ID of Izaque, which was Funkysnipa Cat#XXXX (Censored).<br />
A blue light appeared inside the Teleporter and Lisa disappeared from her spaceship, reappearing on the Teleporter of Izaque.<br />
Izaque looked behind and Lisa was there, she walked outside of the Teleporter and was barefooted with a gray coat, she was so beautiful, the ambient lights of the spaceship shone on her.<br />
He could see her beautiful streams of gray hair, Izaque thought she was amazing and gorgeous, it was incredible to see her in person.<br />
"Hey, Izaque... why are you making that face? It looks like you saw a ghost haha" asks Lisa while laughing a little.<br />
"It's that I... hm... I think you're pretty cute Lisa... and beautiful too... I love you hair... s-sorry to say this..." replied Izaque.<br />
"Hm... no need to apologize... you already said that in Discord... but personally is different... thanks for the compliments Izaque!... I'm happy that you think I'm beautiful... t-thanks..." said Lisa while blushing.<br />
"No problem... hm... I'm a little... shy now... you know," said Izaque.<br />
"Y-Yea... me too... sorry..." replied Lisa.<br />
"No need to say sorry..." said Izaque.<br />
"Can I sit on your bed?" asked Lisa.<br />
"Of course!, feel at home Lisa" replied Izaque.<br />
"Thanks..." said Lisa, who had sat on the bed.<br />
"So... do you want to eat something?... or... watch a movie..." asked Izaque.<br />
"Hm... actually, Izaque... I want you to teach me how to talk with people... come here and sit with me... on the bed..." said Lisa.<br />
Izaque then got up and sat by the side of Lisa, he looked at her beautiful green eyes and she looked at his eyes too.<br />
"So... hm... how do you talk to people?" asked Lisa.<br />
"You simply talk with them, try to talk with some people to get used to it... talk to me, Wendy, Ted, Monika, John, Marina, I'm sure they will be happy to talk with you, you're a pretty cool girl to talk with," said Izaque.<br />
"Oh, thanks Izaque, thank you so much, I'll try to talk with them... personally I mean, I'll try to ask them if I can teleport to their spaceships" replied Lisa.<br />
"Okay, try that, I think that will help," said Izaque.<br />
Then Lisa blushed a little and laid on the bed.<br />
"Do you want to eat or watch something?" asked Izaque.<br />
"Maybe... hm... y-yes... I want... hm... hey Izaque..." said Lisa.<br />
"Yes?" asked Izaque.<br />
"I want you to... I mean... do you like me?... as a friend..." asked Lisa.<br />
"Yes, I like you as a friend..." replied Izaque.<br />
"Oh... hm... me too, do you like my body?..." said Lisa who was blushing like a tomato.<br />
"Y-Yes... I like your hair, it is cute... your face is beautiful... I like... your legs... hm... sorry..." said Izaque while blushing.<br />
"It's okay... I like your hair too... your lips... your face is pretty cute... I like your hands..." said Lisa as she blushed a little.<br />
"T-Thanks Lisa... hm... I'm really happy that you think that... I'm happy you're here with me... I like your companionship..." said Izaque.<br />
"Thank you Izaque, I'm happy here with you too, and no problem, do you want to do something with me?... I-I mean... not in that way, of course, O////O," asked Lisa.<br />
"Yes... n-not in that way too... I want to watch a movie with you... hm... can I turn on my computer?" asked Izaque.<br />
"Of course, the computer is yours," replied Lisa.<br />
Then Izaque got up and clicked on the blue button on his computer case and the login screen appeared, he typed his password and opened the Netflix app.<br />
He looked to Lisa which was behind him and asked if she wanted to watch Eromanga Sensei.<br />
She replied that it was her favorite anime and she liked to draw just like Sagiri.<br />
Izaque was happy because of that, he opened the anime on Netflix, the first episode, and paused it.<br />
"You would like something to eat?, you can pick up in the fridge there," said Izaque.<br />
"Okay, thanks Izaque," said Lisa.<br />
Then Lisa got up and grabbed a plate with some pieces of chocolate cake and a can of coke, she sat at the right side of the double bed and looked at the computer screen.<br />
Izaque activated the large 50-inch television that emerged from the inside of the wall and opened the fridge to grab a sack of Doritos and two cans of coke.<br />
He grabbed a TV controller and sat on the left side of the bed with his food, he laid his sack of Doritos on the bed and played the first episode.<br />
Izaque opened his first can of coke and drank it a little, Lisa also opened hers and drank it a little, then she started eating some pieces of her chocolate cake.<br />
They both watched the episode, Izaque and Lisa loved that anime, they liked to see Sagiri drawing, her brother as a writer.<br />
Lisa felt that she was like Sagiri, drawing and being alone in her room, listening to music and watching anime.<br />
Izaque felt that he was like Masamune, writing fiction and stories, trying to sell them, but he also felt like he was like Sagiri, liking being alone shut in her room.<br />
"I feel like you're my older brother Izaque... I feel like I'm Sagiri and you're Masamune... hm... is it weird if I feel that way?..." asked Lisa.<br />
"Of course not... it is normal, I feel like that too... I feel like you're my younger sister, like Sagiri, you're as cute as her, and have gray hair too..." said Izaque.<br />
"O-Oh... thanks Izaque... you're cute too... my older brother... h-hey Izaque..." said Lisa.<br />
"Yes?..." said Izaque.<br />
"Do you want to lay on my lap?" asked Lisa.<br />
"Yes... I-I would like to do that... you will caress me?" asked Izaque while blushing a lot.<br />
"Of course..." said Lisa.<br />
Then Izaque laid his food and cans of coke on the floor and laid his head on the lap of Lisa.<br />
Lisa began to caress the head of Izaque.<br />
"Thanks, Lisa," said Izaque.<br />
"No problem..." said Lisa.<br />
"Hey... Izaque..." said Lisa.<br />
"Yes?," asked Izaque.<br />
"I think I'm comfortable to be with you right now... I mean... being here with you on your spaceship, I feel good, I feel great... and I'm happy here with you... thanks for letting me come here..." said Lisa.<br />
"Oh... I'm happy that you're comfortable here with me Lisa... I'm pretty comfortable here with you too, so... thanks... I feel good, great and happy too, thank you for making me company today," said Izaque.<br />
"No problem my dear..." said Lisa.<br />
"Hehe, my love," said Izaque.<br />
"My dear, my love... hehe," said Lisa.<br />
"C-Can I kiss your cheek?... h-hm... s-s-sowwy Lisa... I t-think what I said was a little weird..." said Izaque while stuttering and trembling a little. <br />
"Y-You can... feel free to kiss my cheek Izaque, don't worry, it wasn't weird to say that, you're a pretty great friend..." said Lisa.<br />
"Okay," said Izaque, then he gave a small and quick kiss on the cheek of Lisa.<br />
She blushed a lot and giggled a little, feeling happy and shy.<br />
"T-Thanks Izaque... I liked the kiss... OwO," said Lisa.<br />
(Author: Aaaaaaaaaaaaa- what am I doing with my character)<br />
"No problem Lisa..." replied Izaque.<br />
Then they were in the half of episode two, Lisa was a little tired and wanted to sleep.<br />
"Hey Izaque, I'm a little tired, sorry," says Lisa while letting out a long yawn.<br />
"It's okay, do you want to go now? I had fun, don't worry, I loved having your company today," says Izaque.<br />
"Oh, I'm happy that you like my presence and enjoys being with me Izaque, thanks, I think I'll go to my spaceship," says Lisa while smiling.<br />
"Okay, I'll pause the anime, do you want to come here again?, to watch something, or play a little, maybe I can activate the double computer module from the SpaceShip," says Izaque while smiling happily.<br />
"Yes, I would like to come here again to spend time with you, I would like to play or watch something again," replies Lisa, smiling while looking at Izaque.<br />
"Okay, then, send me a message on Discord when you want to come here again okay?" asks Izaque, looking at the eyes of Lisa and feeling happy.<br />
"I will, thanks Izaque," says Lisa.<br />
She gets up and throws her can of coke on the trash bin of the TPF Fridge and also the plate where she ate the chocolate cake.<br />
Lisa walks to the Teleporter and looks at Izaque, she is trying to say something but begins to stutter and blush.<br />
Then she builds up courage and says:<br />
"Hey, Izaque... I would like a hug before I go, c-can you please g-give me one?" says Lisa, while trying to look at the eyes of Izaque, her heart beating faster and her becoming shyer and blushing more, she is unsure if that is what she wants, and she gets a little uncomfortable.<br />
Then Izaque says "Yes, of course, I can..." and walks closer to Lisa, she gets more and more embarrassed as he comes closer to her, he hugs her tight and she hugs him back in return, he starts caressing her soft gray hair, Lisa feels happy and fulfilled, feeling the embrace of Izaque and hearing his breath, Lisa is right where she wants to be now, she is now sure that this is what she wanted.<br />
Izaque is happy in that moment, he didn't know he would be able to hug her, his dearest friend, he liked her a lot, and feeling so close to her made him feel secure, joyful and glad, hearing her breath and feeling her embrace, he wanted that moment to last forever, Izaque wished that he could live forever so he could experience a lot more than that.<br />
After hugging for a while, Lisa and Izaque broke from the hug and Lisa smiled, Izaque smiled back.<br />
"Thanks, Izaque, I had fun today..." says Lisa while smiling from ear to ear and looking at Izaque, her eyes shining.<br />
"No problem Lisa, I had fun today too... thanks for spending so much time with me, it felt great, I love you, my friend," replies Izaque, beaming with joy.<br />
"I love you too, my dearest friend," says Lisa while some tears come up in her eyes, then she enters the teleporter and clicks on a button named 'Teleport To My SpaceShip (Lisa)', waving goodbye while smiling at Izaque, and Izaque waving goodbye back, as the light of the Teleporter begins to shine, she disappears, back to her spaceship, Izaque looks at the Teleporter, then to the white floor.<br />
And starts thinking about his day and tries to consolidate everything he lived through the day, he was just having a boring day at his SpaceShip, then Lisa began talking to him, asking him if she could come over to his spaceship.<br />
He was so happy receiving that message, he sats on the bed and thinks about Lisa, smiling from ear to ear without realizing, recalling the feeling of her hug, her embrace, and her voice, the feeling of watching something with her, it was great.<br />
The two cans of coke and the Doritos sack is still there on the floor, he grabs the cans and put them in the trash bin of the TPF Fridge, then does the same to the Doritos sack, the Fridge deletes everything that is inside the trash bin.<br />
Izaque lays on his bed and thinks about Lisa for a while, daydreaming a little.<br />
Then, he stands up and sits on his chair, deactivating the 50-inch screen and closing the Netflix app, he opens up Discord and sends a message to Lisa, who is offline at the time being.<br />
His username on Discord is 'Funkysnipa Cat'.<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "Hey Lisa, thanks for spending time with me, I liked to watch your favorite anime with you, I think I'm really like Masamune xD, thank you for drinking coke with me, and... h-hm... for the other things we did... you know... me laying in your lap...".<br />
Funkysnipa Cat: "You caressing my hair... and hugging me... I was really happy... t-to be with you today, thanks, Lisa, I love you so much, my friend <3".<br />
He sent the message, grabbed a bottle of cold water from the Fridge and put a song to play on Foobar2000, his music-player on the computer.<br />
The song he was playing was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOxkGD8qRB4" class="w3-text-white">K/DA - POP/STARS (ft. Madison Beer, (G)I-DLE, Jaira Burns) | Music Video - League of Legends</a>.<br />
He liked that song a lot and was addicted to it, Izaque began drinking some sips of his cold water bottle, feeling refreshed, then he noticed that Lisa was online on Discord, she began typing, replying to him.<br />
After a while, she sent a message, it was:<br />
Lisa: "hey, Izaque, thanks for spending time with me too, I was really happy and glad I could meet you in person, and I was happy to watch Eromanga Sensei, Sagiri is like me xD, the coke was great, and...".<br />
Lisa: "hm... yeah... that part of the visit was great too... your hair was so soft to caress, and your embrace was so good to feel... thanks for hugging me... and saying that I'm beautiful... I'm really happy and thankful for that, Izaque, it made me so happy, thanks for having me, I love you so much, my friend <3 :3".<br />
Then Izaque reads the message while drinking water, smiling happily, after some sips, he leaves the bottle on the table and begins typing, replying to Lisa and thanking her.<br />
Izaque then says goodnight to his friends at Discord and leaves his computer on, with a Custom Status saying: ":spaceliving: Sleeping at the SpaceLiving SpaceShip Zzz...".<br />
He lays in his bed and the SpaceShip lights turn off, leaving only the light of the stars, the moon, sun and Earth to light the spaceship, he covers himself and sleeping, relaxing and having good dreams.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
At Lisa's spaceship...<br />
Lisa is eating some Doritos while listening to a podcast about nutrition, looking at her screen and drinking coke sometimes, she thinks a little about Izaque and her trip to his SpaceShip, she had fun there and was happy, Lisa wants to go there again.<br />
After a while, she finishes emptying the sack of Doritos and the can of coke.<br />
She places the sack and can on the trash bin of the Fridge and it deletes both of them.<br />
Then Lisa pauses the podcast, saves the part where she stopped and closes the podcast app.<br />
The gray-haired girl says goodnight to her friends on Discord, and also to Wendy and John.<br />
She wonders if Ted and Monika are having fun there, Lisa only saw them on the SpaceLiving2YearAnniversaryMeeting™ but never talked to them.<br />
Lisa decides that she will talk to them tomorrow on Discord, she leaves her computer on and adds a Custom Status to Discord saying: ":spaceliving: Sleeping at the SpaceLiving Ship :3".<br />
She lays in her bed and the lights of the SpaceShip turn off, Lisa is having a good dream.<br />
