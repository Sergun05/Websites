In the year 2019, there was a tale of some SpaceShips that had an entire house inside them, those spaceships were called the LonelyShips.
<br />Some rumors about those spaceships were spreading across the Internet, people were talking about them on the Internet forums and making theories.
<br />Those spaceships had a super fast and powerful computer on each one of them, it was white, a Play Vegestation 4 gaming console, a bed, a wardrobe.
<br />The spaceships had white walls inside and out, the computers of the spaceships had a modified version of Windows 10 installed on them.
<br />The bed had a blue blanket, it was made of some resistant plastic that was light gray, and the wardrobe was gray.
<br />It also had a laser gun outside of it, two tall windows to see the sun, the moon, and the Earth, an ergonomic chair with casters, adjustable armrests, height, and back.
<br />The spaceship had also a bathroom, and sixteen turbines to move the spaceship when needed, they were deactivated by default.
<br />It had a teleporter that could teleport the resident of the spaceship between other spaceships and also to the Earth.
<br />The teleporter was called LonelyShip Teleporter, the initials were LST and were written on the upper part of its plastic frame, the LST was blue.
<br />That teleporter did not exist in older versions of the LonelyShip.
<br />There was also a fridge that could create anything you thought of, it was called the Thought Powered Fridge or TPF, the TPF was blue.
<br />The spaceship or LonelyShip had an Artificial Intelligence, an AI, that could help the residents of the spaceships manage their spaceships.
<br />The AI was called LonelyShip Artificial Intelligence, or LSAI for short.
<br />That spaceship, the LonelyShip, was part of a network of SpaceShips, the network was called the SpaceLiving SpaceShip Network.
<br />A lot of other people lived inside those spaceships, the spaceships were not close enough for you to see one outside your window.
<br />The company that created those spaceships and the SpaceLiving SpaceShip Network was called Think Outside The Box or TOTB for short.
<br />It created that spaceship network for teens that were depressed and sad about their lives, they did not have a will or a purpose to live for.
<br />The company teleported the depressed teens to the LonelyShips by teleporting them while they were sleeping.
<br />They were teleported to their LonelyShip, and they thought that it was a dream, then, the LSAI told them that they were not in a dream.
<br />After that, the teens asked if they could go back to Earth, the LSAI told them that they could go back.
<br />The computers of the LonelyShips also had the SpaceLiving Network app or program installed by default, for those who did not like to manage their LonelyShips with an AI.
<br />They also asked what they could do there, and the LSAI explained what they could do there.
<br />If you live in a LonelyShip, you can ask the LSAI for anything, like changing wall colors, removing or adding furniture.
<br />The Things Generator, a spectral machine or system that exists inside the LonelyShip, will create those things for you.
<br />It can also delete things that you do not want with its powerful laser beam.
<br />Some of the teens decided to stay there, and live a better life in the SpaceLiving Network, they thought they would have fun there.
<br />Using the computer, playing games, listening to music, watching anime, cartoons, series, movies, and videos.
<br />Some of them thought that it was bad to have to eat food, drink water, and sleep, they still needed to do that, but now they could do it easier.
<br />The TOTB company thought that they would live a better life on their spaceships.
<br />
<br />One of those people is Lisa, a sixteen years old girl, she is a Brazilian girl, she had medium gray hair and green eyes.
<br />She played games on her computer, used the TPF fridge to eat, she also liked to write stories on her computer, Lisa posted them on the Wattpad website for the world to see.
<br />(Wattpad is a website for people to write and read stories, for authors to post their stories and gain readers.)
<br />The girl lived her life there, doing the stuff that she loved to do, the things that made her happy, and the things that had meaning to her.
<br />Lisa had a beautiful LonelyShip with blue walls, it had a super-fast computer with two screens, a PlayStation 4 video game console, and a fridge called Thought Powered Fridge, or TPF.
<br />The spaceship also had a bathroom with a laser toilet bowl that melts the things inside it, a double-size bed, a wardrobe, and a portable video game console called Nintendo 3DS.
<br />Lisa had the normal things that every LonelyShip has, she asked for the LSAI to change her wall colors, she asked for the blue color.
<br />The walls of the LonelyShip were made of a special material that could change its color while in contact with some specific substances.
<br />She has asked the LSAI to change its name, the default name of the LSAI is George and its default gender is male.
<br />Some people theorize on the Internet that George was the father of the creator of TOTB that had passed away.
<br />So they named the LSAI by their father's name.
<br />Lisa gave the name Ana to the LSAI, it was the name of her mother, to remind Lisa of her.
<br />The girl thought about her father, he was named John, she loved her father, but thought he did not like her.
<br />She liked to use her computer because it was super fast and had lots of hard drive space for her to download and store her series, anime, cartoons, and movies.
<br />Lisa loved to live there, write stories, play games, and listen to some Dubstep and Japanese songs on her computer.
<br />Today she had nothing important to do, but she wanted to play some games on the Steam gaming platform.
<br />(Steam is software where you can download free and paid games to play on your computer.)
<br />Lisa turned her computer on and sat on the chair, clicked on the Steam program, and waited for it to open.
<br />The chair that she had was very comfortable, it was like a gaming chair, it had adjustable things and a backrest lever to tilt back and relax.
<br />She opened a game called Titanfall 2 to play a little, she loved that game, it had lots of futuristic things and mechas, robots, and laser weapons.
<br />Lisa entered a multiplayer match and made a 10/3 score, 10 are the kills and 3 are the deaths.
<br />She liked that match, then she closed Steam and opened the programs called Mozilla Firefox and Spotify.
<br />(Mozilla Firefox is a web browser, Spotify is a music player where you can listen to online music without downloading it.)
<br />Lisa selected a Dubstep song on Firefox to blast on her speakers and started banging her head to the beat of the song.
<br />She liked the fact that she could hear music at full volume and no one would hear and be annoyed.
<br />(Because in space, no one can hear you scream, just kidding, hehe. ^^)
<br />
<br />Then she opened the social network website called Facebook to talk with her friends and started to talk with one friend of hers called Anny.
<br />(Facebook is a social network where you can create an account and make a profile with information about you, it can be used to talk and make friends online.)
<br />"What's up?" asked Lisa.
<br />"I'm fine, how about you?" replied Anny.
<br />"Me too, what are you up to?" said Lisa.
<br />"Just playing some God of War on my PS4, what about you, Lisa?" asked Anny with a smile emoji.
<br />"Oh, that's cool, I'm just listening to some Dubstep," said Lisa.
<br />"That sounds great, what song are you listening to?" asked Anny.
<br />"The song is called 'Still Got Something' from God's Warrior," replied Lisa.
<br />"I'll listen to it after I finish playing, can you send it to me?" said Anny.
<br />Then Lisa looked at the Firefox tab that had the song playing on the YouTube website.
<br />She clicked on the text box on her conversation with Anny and typed:
<br />"Yes, I'll send the link to you Anny."
<br />"Okay, thanks ^^," said Anny.
<br />Lisa then sent the YouTube link of the Dubstep song to Anny.
<br />The gray-haired girl said: "I'm gonna do something else now, good game for you, bye. ^^"
<br />"Bye Lisa ^^, thanks for the link, hehe," replied Anny.
<br />"No problem, hehe," said Lisa.
<br />
<br />Lisa closed the Mozilla Firefox program, turned her PlayStation 4 on, and grabbed its controller, the PS4 was being displayed on a second screen that Lisa had.
<br />She put the PS4 screen on her center screen, she only used her right screen to put something she was not going to look at often, doing the opposite would hurt her neck.
<br />The girl also opened her music player on her computer which was called Foobar2000 and closed the Spotify music player program.
<br />She had lots of gigaBytes of music stored in her solid-state drive Lisa liked to have such a big library of music.
<br />The girl had five solid-state drives (SSDs) on her computer, she could see each one of them on the file explorer of her computer.
<br />Each one of them had 10TB (Terabytes) of hard drive space, she had one for music, one for games, one for the modified version of Windows 10, one for her files, and one for media, movies, cartoons, anime, series.
<br />Then Lisa opened the game called Grand Theft Auto V on the PS4 and started playing, she was playing the online mode of that game.
<br />Lisa thought about when she played The Grand Theft Auto V game on her computer, it ran clean and fast, without lagging.
<br />She liked to have such a powerful computer with a good graphics card, a fast SSD, and a fast CPU, the AMD Ryzen‚Ñ¢ Threadripper‚Ñ¢ with sixty-four cores and one hundred twenty-eight threads.
<br />The CPU (Central Processing Unit) worked with a base clock at 2.9GHz, but Lisa's was overclocked, it worked at a 4.3GHz clock.
<br />The girl was playing with her friends, and she was listening to the Dubstep song called "Geoxor - Turn Around" on the Foobar2000 music player.
<br />She liked that song and sang a little bit of it while listening to the sound of the Dubstep basses, she was happy playing and listening to music.
<br />The girl felt that she was a little hungry, she became AFK (away from the keyboard) in the game and laid her controller on the desk.
<br />She got up and opened her TPF fridge, it was an automatic fridge that created any food that the person thought of, it had the Food Generator spectral machine inside it.
<br />You could think of a pizza and a pizza would appear instantly inside the fridge.
<br />Then Lisa grabbed the cup of chocolate milk and the hamburger that were inside the fridge, she sat at her desk and started eating the hamburger and drinking the milk.
<br />After eating, she registered the time that she ate with a Python script called "Set Food Time.py", she continued to play the game.
<br />She played for some minutes, then Lisa told her friends that she was going to do something else.
<br />The girl closed the Grand Theft Auto V game and turned her PS4 off.
<br />She put to play a live stream of songs of the Future Bass genre on the Twitch website and rested a little while laying in her bed.
<br />The girl had over-ear wireless headphones, they were good for sound isolation, they had good sound stage and acoustics.
<br />Lisa did not need the sound isolation or noise-canceling feature as there were no sounds in her LonelyShip, only hers.
<br />(Twitch is a website where you can watch live streams, the majority of them are of gaming, but there is also chat, instruments, song Livestreams, trips, react.)
<br />
<br />Lisa also liked to watch movies, series, anime, cartoons, and YouTube videos.
<br />She liked to download them with a program called Utorrent and another one called MegaSync.
<br />The girl liked to download HD, Full HD, and 60 FPS videos from YouTube with a program called 4K Video Downloader.
<br />After resting a little, Lisa thought about watching a movie, she got up and closed the live stream of the Future Bass music genre.
<br />She liked Marvel and its movies, she had downloaded a movie called Avengers: Infinity War from Marvel on her computer, she stored it on her media SSD.
<br />Lisa grabbed a purple plastic bowl of Doritos and a bottle of Coca-cola from inside the TPF fridge to eat and drink while watching the movie.
<br />Then the girl opened her video player that was called VLC Media Player and opened the video file of Avengers: Infinity War with it.
<br />The gray-haired girl watched the movie while eating, making some pauses to go to the bathroom.
<br />Lisa commented on some parts of the movie, she typed the time of the movie, like 01:15:35, and typed what she thought, or how she felt.
<br />She even opened the Discord program on her computer to talk about the movie with her friends.
<br />(Discord is a social network platform for gamers but non-gamers also use it.)
<br />The girl loved the movie, all the action, the heroes, the special effects, she was sad about Spider-Man.
<br />Lisa created a text file on her computer to write everything that she thought about the movie, her feelings, and her opinions.
<br />Then she saved the file and closed it, after that, she opened an episode of the series called The Walking Dead to watch.
<br />The girl watched the entire episode while eating the rest of her Doritos and drinking the rest of her Coca-cola bottle.
<br />Lisa liked that series, she watched it when she was younger, it brings back good memories to her, even if it is a little violent and scary.
<br />It reminds her of a special someone, of the time she watched that series with her older brother when Lisa lived on Earth.
<br />She did not clearly remember how he was, how he looked like, or what his name was.
<br />It has been some time since she saw him, since she had bad grades and thought her life was bad.
<br />It was at that moment when Lisa got teleported to her LonelyShip.
<br />After she started living on her LonelyShip, she started forgetting about her family, her brother.
<br />
<br />Then she opened another live stream of the Future Bass music genre on YouTube.
<br />After some time drinking water and listening to Future Bass music, she got tired and said good night to her friends on Discord.
<br />Then she turned both her computer, putting the controller inside a drawer of the computer table, she said good night to Ana, the LSAI.
<br />Ana turned the LonelyShip lights for Lisa to sleep, she could only look through the windows to see some light.
<br />The LSAI, Ana, turned the turbines of the spaceship on and left the LonelyShip spinning slowly, so Lisa could see the Earth, moon, and sun sometimes through the windows.
<br />Her body was tired, Lisa laid in her bed and closed her eyes, she had a dream where she was going to school, had to clean her room, had to get high grades.
<br />For her that dream was a nightmare, she did not like that style of life and did not like to do the hard stuff.
<br />Then, after a while, that dream disappeared and another dream took its place, a better dream.
<br />Lisa was dreaming of using her supercomputer, listening to Dubstep songs, and talking to her friends on Discord.
<br />She liked that dream, she was happy and wanted to wake up just to do the same thing that she was doing in the dream.
<br />Lisa loved the life she lived, she had a spaceship that had a bed, a wardrobe, the TPF fridge, a supercomputer, a PlayStation 4, Nintendo 3DS, and a laser gun.
<br />The girl had a lot of things to make her happy and entertain her, to make her feel complete, to make her life feel worth.
<br />Lisa wanted to play games, watch, write, listen, draw, and talk, create, explore the world of the Internet, experience things, to feel things.
<br />She wanted to live alone inside her spaceship, inside her LonelyShip, she wanted to do a lot of fun things, to eat delicious food and drink delicious drinks.

(The John in this chapter is the SpaceLiving version of John of my story called $the_story_of_the_nazzevo_brothers_linked;, but he lives in a universe where the SpaceLiving SpaceShip Network exists.)
<br />Still in the year 2019, there was the tale of a super innovative spaceship where you had a lot of things to do.
<br />The SpaceShips were called LonelyShips because you were lonely there, there were only you there.
<br />There were a lot of people that lived in the LonelyShips, they created a community.
<br />The residents of those SpaceShips created a lot of Discord servers to communicate and talk about being a LonelyShipper.
<br />(Discord is a social network platform for gamers but non-gamers also use it.)
<br />Being a LonelyShipper is being a resident of one of the LonelyShips of the SpaceLiving SpaceShip Network.
<br />They theorized about where TOTB resided, who were its creators, and how they built the LonelyShips.
<br />How they built that incredible technology, that could remove stuff from the spaceship quickly and could generate food and things with the Food and Things Generator.
<br />It was like a social movement or a digital movement, just like the bronies, furries and 4channers were some years ago.
<br />These three movements are still active, but they are not as famous as before.
<br />The LonelyShippers liked to be in the LonelyShipper movement, Lisa did not participate in that.
<br />She was just her, spending her time at her computer, without a movement to stick to or a stereotype.
<br />The girl liked to be a LonelyShipper, she liked the opportunity that TOTB gave to teens, to live happier in the LonelyShips.
<br />She liked the status of being a LonelyShipper but did not talk too much in the SpaceLiving Discord server.
<br />Lisa was just there to check the news and announcements that TOTB posted there.
<br />She was on the official Discord server of the SpaceLiving, created by TOTB.
<br />A Discord server is like a group where you can hang out, you can create channels for different categories or topics of messages and posts.
<br />A gaming company can create a server to post announcements of updates of the game, and also for players to report errors in the game.
<br />Lisa was encouraged to create a Discord account when she was teleported to the LonelyShip.
<br />Think Outside The Box did that to help the sad teens to overcome depression, with people to talk to and to vent to on the official Discord server.
<br />
<br />There was also a boy named John that lived in a LonelyShip, he had seventeen years old and was a LonelyShipper, he liked to play games on the Steam digital gaming platform.
<br />He was also on the Official TOTB SpaceLiving Discord server, he talked in the general chat and saw the announcements on the chat of updates.
<br />John liked to play a lot of games, he was very competitive at them and did not like to lose.
<br />He was at his LonelyShip and did not know what time was on Earth, but he could choose what timezone that his computer clock would have.
<br />John only wanted to play games and was thinking about some things while being laid at his bed.
<br />"Why I'm in this bed? I was alone some years ago and wanted to stay away from the others.
<br />Because they made me angry, I was suffering because of them... And they annoyed me too.
<br />Also, I feel that I was someone in another place or an alternate universe.
<br />Like I was some kind of hero or teacher of martial arts and I was teaching martial arts to some friends.
<br />I feel like I was teaching two persons, Juju and Sizaque I guess.
<br />I should stop thinking about that, maybe I'm too tired or something, I should get back to the computer," thought him, looking at the ceiling.
<br />Then John got out of his bed and turned the computer on, he opened Steam to play some games.
<br />John had a friend called Mark, John felt that they were friends in an alternate universe.
<br />John opened the game Apex Legends to play, it was a new game that EA launched and was a Battle Royale game, John wanted to test it.
<br />(A Battle Royale game is a game where there is a set number of players on a map, like one hundred, and they have to fight to see who lasts, the last one alive wins the match.)
<br />He played for a few minutes and liked it, John was very good at the game and had made many kills.
<br />Then he closed the game and called his friend Mark on Discord to play some Overwatch.
<br />They played a little while talking using the voice-call feature of Discord, Mark also lived in a LonelyShip.
<br />Mark and John were very good friends, they were friends on Earth too, virtual friends, before being teleported to a LonelyShip.
<br />They read about the rumor of the LonelyShips on the Internet one time, they thought it would be awesome to live there, to have a powerful computer for free.
<br />Then, some time passed, the two were sleeping, it was night, they dreamed about the LonelyShip and the SpaceLiving Network.
<br />John and Mark were teleported each one to a LonelyShip, they passed through the LonelyShip initiation, asked if they could go back, and asked what they could do there.
<br />The LSAI George guided them through the process, they decided to stay, the LSAI knows a lot about feelings and humans.
<br />It could know that John had a friend, George told John that this friend was also in a LonelyShip.
<br />"Really?" asked John, "Yes," replied George.
<br />Then John created a Discord account, he added Mark and they talked, they were so happy talking to each other.
<br />Telling that they both got into a LonelyShip.
<br />"Yooo dude, I'm in a LonelyShip dude," said Mark in a text message.
<br />"Yeah, hehe, so awesome, now we can play a lot of games together dude!" replied John.
<br />
<br />Now, back to the present, after some time playing, John won some rounds and wanted to close the game.
<br />"Hey, I'm gonna go do something else man, see you later," said John in a text message on Discord to Mark.
<br />"Oh, okay man, see you later, bye," replied Mark.
<br />John liked to read some stories on the Internet on a website called Wattpad, he wanted to write something too.
<br />But he was not very good at it, he liked to read the stories of a girl named Lisa on Wattpad, she was a LonelyShipper too.
<br />(Wattpad is a website for people to write and read stories, for authors to post their stories and gain readers.)
<br />John wondered how Lisa could make him feel the emotions that he felt, how she could make him love the characters.
<br />Lisa has published a lot of stories on Wattpad and other writing websites, she loved to write stories.
<br />John was trying to learn more about writing and stories, he has written some drafts on his computer.
<br />He wanted to talk to Lisa, to ask her for help on writing, John noticed that she wrote her Discord name and Discriminator in her profile bio.
<br />The text said: "If you want help in writing or you like my stories and want to talk about them, just add me on Discord: Lisa#1321".
<br />Then John added her on Discord, he already liked and commented on the chapters of Lisa's stories.
<br />But he wanted to talk to her, to ask questions about writing and how to write better.
<br />John sent a message to her on Discord, "Hello, how are you, Lisa?" asked him, with a smile emoji.
<br />"I'm John from Wattpad, I love your stories, hehe.
<br />You wrote your Discord name and Discriminator on your profile bio, right?
<br />You said people could ask for help in writing or talk about your stories.
<br />Sorry for making so many questions, It's that I started writing some months ago, and was trying to get better at writing," explained him.
<br />
<br />After some time, John noticed that Lisa was online, he got excited and waited for her to reply, she began typing.
<br />"Hey, John, I know you from Wattpad ^^, you always comment and give likes on my stories, thanks for loving them, hehe ^^.
<br />My father's name is also John, what a coincidence, hehe.
<br />And thanks for commenting and liking them.
<br />Yes, I did that, you can ask for help or talk with me about my stories. :3
<br />It's okay asking questions, I started some months ago too, can I see a piece of your work? Like... The story you're most proud of?" asked her.
<br />"Yes, I will send you the text file of it, okay?" asked John, thinking about his draft which was called "The Return of the Beast".
<br />"That's an interesting coincidence, hehe," said John about Lisa's father having the same name as him.
<br />"Okay, hehe," replied Lisa with a smiley emoji.
<br />Then John sent her a file named "The Return of the Beast.txt" of 17KB (Kilobytes) of size to Lisa.
<br />After some time reading the draft, Lisa started writing a message to John.
<br />"That was cool to read, the story was interesting, but the way you executed it, that was a little..." said her.
<br />"Bad?" John asked.
<br />"Not bad, but, was not... The way you express yourself, or the way you write, feels a little forced.
<br />Try to read more and learn more about how to use words, how to form phrases, I guess that's my tip for you, try to do that.
<br />Try to read more and you'll find your style, read stories that you think you'll like, and try to watch something, listen to some music.
<br />Then get those feelings that you're feeling for that thing you're watching or that song and try to get them out, by writing about it.
<br />Write more and more, and keep what you wrote, don't delete it, even if it is bad, after writing it for some time, you'll get better.
<br />And search on the Internet about something you're not sure of, like writing rules, or words, that's what I did.
<br />Keep writing more and you'll become proud of your writing just like me," replied Lisa with a smiley emoji.
<br />"Okay, I will try that, thanks for helping me Lisa, I was scared and excited to talk to you," said John.
<br />"Why?" asked Lisa.
<br />"Cause I love your work, and thought you were an inaccessible or busy person," replied John.
<br />"If I were inaccessible why I would put my Discord name in my bio? xD
<br />Also, I live in a LonelyShip, so I'm very accessible, I've got nothing to do but play games, write stories, watch things, and eat, haha," said Lisa.
<br />"Oh, that's cool Lisa, I live in one too, hehe, it's very good to meet another LonelyShipper, can I ask your age?" asked John.
<br />"Yes, I'm 16 years old, what about you John?" replied Lisa.
<br />"I'm 17 years old, hehe," replied John.
<br />"It was fun to talk with you, hehe, nice to meet you, John," said Lisa.
<br />"Nice to meet you too, Lisa," replied John, with a smile emoji.
<br />"I'm gonna leave to write my story called 'The Oddities of Nature', see you later ^^," said Lisa.
<br />"Okay, sorry to bother you ^^," said John.
<br />"You didn't bother me, also, I want to read your stories when you get better ^^, please send them to me so I can read them and tell you what I think, hehe," said Lisa.
<br />"It would be an honor to send you some of them ^^, my mentor, hehe," said John.
<br />"Aww, I'm not that good, hehe, thanks John, üòä" replied Lisa, she was happy.
<br />"See you later, Lisa, üòä" said John.
<br />
<br />After that John minimized his Discord window and started searching how to write better and how to use words better.
<br />He wanted to get better at writing to show Lisa his stories and was super excited to do that.
<br />He learned a lot and was trying to write some drafts on his computer, trying to improve every day.
<br />John used the Notepad++ program on his computer to write his drafts.
<br />(Notepad++ is a program similar to the Notepad that comes with Windows, but better.)
<br />After some time writing he wrote something that he liked, John was tired, he yawned and relaxed back in the chair.
<br />John had the SpaceLiving Network app installed on his computer, he could receive updates and information of the new features that TOTB added to the LonelyShips.
<br />He had applied to the SpaceLiving Helper form, it was a role that helped in the Official TOTB SpaceLiving Discord server.
<br />That role had to help in the vent chat, in the help and questions chat, he helped people who were sad and had depression and helped people who had questions about the LonelyShips.
<br />TOTB had created that role for people to volunteer to help in the Discord server, and to help LonelyShippers from all around the galaxy and the universe.
<br />After thinking about some things while looking at the ceiling, John turned off his computer and laid in his bed to sleep, John wanted to talk to Lisa again to show her his stories.
<br />The LSAI of John was called Mary, she turned the LonelyShip's lights off for John to sleep, she said good night to him and he said good night back.
<br />He slept, wanting to improve his writing more because he got inspired by someone, he had someone to help him.
<br />John waited for a new day to come, where he would write more and more, listen to music, play games and eat delicious food.
<br />He had a good dream, a really good dream about a certain spaceship and a special someone to him.
<br />
<br />(I wrote this chapter on 17/11/2019 and re-revised it on 25/04/2021.
<br />
<br />I liked to put John from my story $the_story_of_the_nazzevo_brothers_linked; in the SpaceLiving Universe.
<br />I love to make crossovers between my stories, Nazzevo (TSOTNB), The Life of Littletato (TLOL), and SpaceLiving (SL).
<br />Even if Earth did not exist in the SpaceLiving Universe, I think they would be fine, they don't need Planet Earth.
<br />They have self-sustainable SpaceShips where the energy, food, water, and electricity never ends, so why they would need Earth?
<br />Tell me what you think about the story and this little bit here using the "Chapter Comment" button.
<br />Thank you for reading, if you are my friend in Discord, Wattpad, Messenger, Twitter, Hangouts, please send me a message saying that I'm cute, oops, no.
<br />A message saying that you read this part, thank yoooou ^^ :3)

Lisa was in her LonelyShip, writing her story called "The Oddities of Nature", she finished the current chapter which was chapter number nine, she saved the text file.
<br />After that, she reviewed and published that chapter of her story on Wattpad, after some minutes, the chapter had five views and two comments.
<br />(Wattpad is a website for people to write and read stories, for authors to post their stories and gain readers.)
<br />Lisa was happy about that, she liked to have people that liked to read what she writes and people who comment on her stories.
<br />Then Lisa opened the Netflix website to watch some series, she liked to watch the "The Walking Dead" series.
<br />(Netflix is a website and mobile app where you can watch series, movies, cartoons, and anime online, using a paid plan.)
<br />Lisa was in the second episode of the seventh season, the girl liked the story and the characters, but she was a little scared to watch it sometimes.
<br />The Discord program was open on her computer when she started watching the episode "The Walking Dead S07E03(86) 'The Cell'".
<br />(Discord is a social network platform for gamers but non-gamers also use it.)
<br />The details of what she was watching appeared on her Discord profile, as a status of the Discord program, showing the title and number of the episode.
<br />She paused the video and got some popcorn and a Coca-cola can from out of her TPF fridge, she liked to eat popcorn while watching things.
<br />Then she sat in her chair and put the video to play, Lisa ate while watching the episode, she opened the SpaceLiving Network App on her computer.
<br />Lisa dimmed the light levels of the LonelyShip to watch the episode better, without the bright light disturbing her.
<br />A character from the survivor group of Rick Grimes was jailed in the cell of an enemy of the group, he had to stay there as a hostage.
<br />Lisa was sad for him, she wanted to live there in the apocalypse, Lisa thought that it would be good and fun, but also dangerous.
<br />She wanted to go there to save him, to kill people of the Negan group, the girl hated the Negan group, they killed people for no reason.
<br />After forty minutes of watching it while eating popcorn and drinking Coca-cola, the episode ended, it was registered on Lisa's Netflix account.
<br />The friends of Lisa from Discord could see what Lisa was watching on Netflix, John commented about the episode of The Walking Dead that Lisa was watching.
<br />
<br />The girl looked at the window at her left and saw the black emptiness of space, thinking that she can not see the sun like on Earth, but she has the clock on her computer.
<br />She knew that she could change her computer's clock to any time or timezone on Earth, but that would not reflect the actual time in there.
<br />Because there is no way to keep track of time on the LonelyShip, there is no sun or moon to look at, people could not tell if it was day or night on Earth.
<br />Lisa switched to the Discord window, she wanted to talk with her friends on Discord and changed her status to online, she noticed that John was online.
<br />(Discord is a social network platform for gamers but non-gamers also use it.)
<br />The girl read John's message about The Walking Dead and replied to it.
<br />"Did you got better at writing?" asked Lisa.
<br />After some time, John replied, "Yes, I searched on the Internet how to get better at writing, how to write better, and I wrote a draft today".
<br />"Oh, that's cool, can I see it?" asked Lisa with smiley emoji.
<br />"Yes, of course, I'll send the file to you, okay?" asked John.
<br />"Okay ^^," replied Lisa.
<br />John sent her a file named "Bubbles and Cream.txt" with 7KB of size.
<br />"I will read it, wait for a little ^^," replied Lisa.
<br />After some time reading, Lisa opened the Discord window again to reply to John.
<br />"I think this is better than the other story you sent me, I mean... The way you wrote, it's very good.
<br />The grammar is better too, I liked the story, I think the concept is interesting, you should publish it somewhere, like Wattpad.
<br />I would be happy to read your story there ^^," replied Lisa.
<br />Then John read the whole message and started typing.
<br />"Oh, okay, I'm happy that you think that about my story, I tried to get better at writing just because I admire you and your work so much.
<br />And I wanted to make you proud of me, so thanks for liking my story, I'm very happy because of that, and thanks for helping me get better at writing.
<br />I will post it on Wattpad, thanks for the suggestion ^^," replied John.
<br />Then Lisa started typing, "I'm happy that I could help and inspire you too, thanks for that.
<br />I'm gonna make something else now, see you later, John ^^," said Lisa.
<br />John then replied to Lisa, "Okay, see you later, Lisa, hehe ^^".
<br />
<br />Lisa was so happy that she inspired John to get better at writing, which made her want to do more stories and to write more, to inspire people and make them happy.
<br />She was looking at her Direct Messages in Discord and looked at Anny's conversation with her, Anny also had Discord.
<br />Lisa liked to talk with her, she wanted to play some games with Anny.
<br />They are virtual friends, Lisa met her at a game that she played when she was on Earth.
<br />She sent a message to Anny, "Hey Anny, wanna play something?"
<br />"Yes, what do you wanna play?" asked Anny.
<br />"I don't know, maybe GTA 5, or Terraria if you want," replied Lisa.
<br />Anny said. "I would like to play both, hehe, ^^".
<br />Then Lisa and Anny entered a private server on Discord to go on a voice-call, Lisa called a Music Bot to the voice-call to listen to some music while playing with Anny.
<br />Lisa and Anny played the game GTA 5 Online a little, they liked that game, it was very fun, they also played Terraria a little.
<br />They made some theft missions on GTA 5 Online, they chilled around the city while driving.
<br />Lisa and Anny continued building a house for the NPCs (Non-Player Character) to live, the guide, the nurse, and the other.
<br />After some time playing, Lisa told Anny that she was going to do something else.
<br />"I'm gonna do something else Anny, see you later ^^," said Lisa.
<br />"Okay, hehe, see you later Lisa ^^," replied Anny.
<br />Lisa opened the Mozilla Firefox browser and opened the Wattpad website, she started looking for some stories to read.
<br />(Mozilla Firefox is a web browser, Wattpad is a website for people to write and read stories, for authors to post their stories and gain readers.)
<br />She received a notification telling her that the <a href="https://thestake2.netlify.app/pequenata üìò/" target="_blank" class="w3-text-white">The Life of Littletato</a> story received a new chapter, chapter number eighteen.
<br />The story was written by a user called "Stake2", he was a boy, he loved to write stories, he had so much love for his stories.
<br />Lisa liked that story, she liked to see the characters of Littletato and Julia living their lives, she thought they were so cute together and a cute couple.
<br />The girl loved to read the chapter, it was so much fun, she gave it a vote and commented on it saying what she thought of it.
<br />"Hey Stake2 ^^, I loved the part where she opened Vegecord to talk with her friends :3
<br />Vegecord is Discord, right?
<br />I love it when you change the name of things to put 'vegetables' in the middle. xD
<br />I also liked the fact that Littletato writes stories too, that is so much fun, I love to write too. ^^
<br />And I'm happy for Julia because she got a job, now she'll be able to buy her things. :3
<br />I liked the conversation between Yam and Julia, and Julia inviting him to the barbecue.
<br />'Vegiantart'. xD
<br />I loved this chapter ^^," commented Lisa, on chapter number eighteen of The Life of Littletato.
<br />
<br />After some minutes, the author replied to her comment.
<br />"Hello Lisa ^^, thanks for voting on my story, and thanks for liking and commenting on it, I'm really happy to receive your feedback and your comments, hehe ^^.
<br />Yes, Vegecord is equal to Discord. xD
<br />I love to do that xD, sometimes I come up with some very funny names, it is very cool. xD
<br />Sometimes I "self-insert" into her, like, I write Littletato like I would be, or how I would act, and sometimes my interests.
<br />That's why she likes reading and writing stories, it's because I like it. ^^
<br />Hehe, I'm happy to find someone that loves writing as much as me :3
<br />I liked to write about Julia getting a job, and about her conversation with Yam.
<br />it was so much fun writing about Julia trying to find a job, and finding it, hehe, It'll be better when she starts working. ^^
<br />uwu xD.
<br />I'm glad that you loved it ^^, thankies you for commenting :3," commented Stake2, replying to Lisa's comment.
<br />
<br />Lisa was happy to give feedback and to comment on the stories that she liked, she also liked to receive a happy and gentle response like the one of Stake2.
<br />She felt hungry, got up and opened her TPF fridge, there was a packet of chocolate stuffed biscuits there, a packet of Doritos, and also a cup of Coca-cola inside it.
<br />Lisa picked up all the things and placed them on top of her computer table, she opened the packet of chocolate biscuits and filled a plastic bowl that she grabbed from the fridge with them.
<br />She opened a movie on Netflix to watch, the movie was called "Avengers: Infinity War".
<br />The girl watched the movie while eating the biscuits, Doritos, and drinking a cup of Coca-cola.
<br />She liked the movie, it was very fun, she was happy to see all the action, special effects, and heroes, she cheered for Iron Man.
<br />Lisa added the movie to her list of watched movies, it was a text file inside her computer, where she registered all of her watched movies.
<br />She registered the movie on the text files of her History of Watched things with a Python script called Watch.py, Lisa also knew how to code, to make programs to help her.
<br />The girl had a friend that she met in Google+, the nickname of her friend on Discord was "Funkysnipa Cat", the same he used in Google+.
<br />(Google+ was a social network website created by Google in 2011, in an attempt to challenge other social networks, linking other Google products like Google Drive, Blogger, and YouTube.
<br />Google+ died on 2 of April 2019 due to people finding out the privacy violations that Google had hidden about Google+.
<br />And Google closed Google+ because it felt shame about the privacy violations, Google+ was house to a lot of fans of things and new fandoms.
<br />Such as the Five Night's at Freddy's fandom in 2014, My Little Pony, anime. a lot of Brazilians loved to use Google+, there was a movement called the Funky Cats on Google+.)
<br />Funkysnipa Cat was the first to start the conversation on Discord when they met again.
<br />Lisa opened the Hangouts app of Google to ask Funkysnipa Cat for his Discord name and discriminator.
<br />(Hangouts is an app that was linked to Google+, and you could use your Google+ account to talk in it.)
<br />He and Lisa were Brazilians and native speakers of the Brazilian Portuguese language.
<br />"Hello, you're that friend I had in Google+, right?" Funkysnipa Cat asked in Brazilian Portuguese
<br />"Hey, yes, I'm that friend ^^, I'm glad that I asked for your Discord name and discriminator," replied Lisa.
<br />They talked a little and started to know each other again, they liked to talk about stories, anime, cartoons, series, video games, and music, they had a lot in common.
<br />Both Funky and Lisa loved to write stories, Lisa wanted to write a story together with Funky sometime.
<br />The real name of Funky was Izaque, Lisa liked to be his friend, she was happy to have a gentle, caring, and interesting friend such as him.
<br />Izaque was happy about meeting Lisa in that Google+ community about anime.
<br />While talking to Lisa on Discord, Izaque remembered their first conversation on Hangouts.
<br />They were talking about My Little Pony and anime, Lisa said that she liked the Eromanga Sensei anime, Izaque said that his first anime was Sword Art Online.
<br />After some time knowing about each other, Izaque discovered that Lisa lived inside a LonelyShip.
<br />Izaque lived on the normal Planet Earth, he thought that was an interesting fact about Lisa, the fact that she lives inside a spaceship.
<br />
<br />At the beginning of the conversation, Izaque sent Lisa the link to his Wattpad profile, Lisa and Izaque talked about stories for a while.
<br />Lisa looked at Izaque's profile on Wattpad, she noticed that he was Stake2, the writer who created <a href="https://thestake2.netlify.app/pequenata üìò/" target="_blank" class="w3-text-white">The Life of Littletato</a>.
<br />After that, she came back to Discord to type a message to Izaque.
<br />"Izaque... Are you Stake2?!" asked Lisa, surprised.
<br />"Yeah... Sorry for not telling you," replied Izaque.
<br />"I love your stories! Hehe, so you're a professional writer, hehe," said Lisa with a smirk as an emoji.
<br />"Hehe, I'm not that good, but thanks, you don't fall behind too, I love The Oddities of Nature, hehe ^^," said Izaque.
<br />"Thanks! Hehe :3, let's write something together sometime okay?" asked Lisa.
<br />"I would love to, Lisa ^^," replied Izaque.
<br />They also played some games together sometimes, while talking on Discord voice calls.
<br />The author of this story is Izaque or Funkysnipa Cat, but that is the SpaceLiving Universe version of Izaque.
<br />Yes, that's it, I'm Izaque and I'm writing about Lisa, my dear friend, this is a weird thing to do, right? Well, maybe not, I asked for her permission.
<br />Because a lot of stories do not talk directly with the reader, they tell a story to the reader.
<br />But now I'm talking directly to you, and I include myself in my own story, is it common for authors to do this?
<br />Please answer me if you know. xD
<br />I think you're probably making a face like this right now: "O_O", now, going back to narrator style.
<br />Lisa said to Izaque what she did on the days that she spent on her LonelyShip, she told him about the SpaceLiving Network and the LonelyShips.
<br />He wanted to write a story about Lisa living on the SpaceLiving Network, Lisa explained the things to him.
<br />Then Izaque started writing his called "SpaceLiving", about the SpaceLiving SpaceShip Network in 2019.
<br />Izaque loved to write that story (*wink*), it was a story about the SpaceShip that Lisa lived, and also about the spaceships Network called the SpaceLiving spaceship Network.
<br />He analyzed the day of Lisa and wrote a story about that, then he sent the story text file to Lisa for her to check.
<br />Lisa read the first chapter of the story, she liked it, Lisa gave Izaque permission to publish his story on Wattpad and to send the story to his friends.
<br />The girl thought that she had a happy life, she wrote stories, had some good friends like Izaque, Anny, and John to talk with.
<br />She could eat delicious food using her TPF fridge, she was happy living in her LonelyShip, writing, watching anime, and other things.
<br />Izaque wrote, revised, and posted the first chapter of the SpaceLiving story on Wattpad, he sent the link to Lisa on Discord.
<br />Lisa read the whole chapter, it was very good, and it explained very well the SpaceLiving Network, and how it worked, she gave a vote and commented on the story.
<br />"Hey Izaque, I loved the first chapter of SpaceLiving, hehe, it was so well written.
<br />You described the systems and technologies of the LonelyShips, and about the wish of TOTB to make teens happy.
<br />Thanks for writing it, hehe, I'll wait anxiously for the next chapter, tell me if you need more content, hehe ^^," responded Lisa.
<br />"Hehe, thanks, I'm glad that you loved it, Lisa, hehe ^^, I like to write about technologies, I love them. xD
<br />I want to write about this friend of yours, John, as you said to me.
<br />Can you ask him if he's willing to share his SpaceLiving story?" asked Izaque.
<br />"Oh, okay, I'm gonna ask him ^^," replied Lisa.
<br />The girl felt a little tired, she said goodbye to Izaque, telling him goodnight, thanking him for the talk, smiling happily while looking at the screen.
<br />Lisa turned her computer off and laid on her bed, the LSAI, Ana, turned the LonelyShip's lights off and she could see the moon through the left window of the spaceship.
<br />Ana left the LonelyShip turning slowly, using its turbines, for Lisa to see the moon, sun, and the Earth moving slowly through the windows.
<br />The LonelyShips's temperature was very good, she covered herself with the blanket and slept, having good dreams about the spaceship, and her friends.
<br />
<br />(I write this chapter on 19/11/2019.
<br />I finished re-revising it on 26/04/2021.
<br />I revised while listening to some Dubstep songs.
<br />And I arrived at a song that I loved, I left it on repeat.
<br />The is called <a class="w3-text-white" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2P1_v9aFV8">Skybreak & Mizu - Aurora</a>.
<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2P1_v9aFV8
<br />I love that song so much, it is awesome! So calm and good to write SpaceLiving, hehe. xD
<br />I love to sing it and feel it while writing SpaceLiving or anything.
<br />That song makes me feel so happy, I suggest that you listen to it, hehe. :3)

There was a boy that also lived in a LonelyShip, his name was Ted and had brown hair, he had nineteen years old and loved to spend time on his spaceship, eating things and watching Netflix.
<br />(Netflix is a website and mobile app where you can watch series, movies, cartoons, and anime online, using a paid plan.)
<br />But his spaceship was different, it had a teleporter in it.
<br />The teleporter was called LonelyShip Teleporter, the initials were LST and were written on the upper part of its plastic frame, the LST was blue.
<br />(That teleporter did not exist in older versions of the LonelyShip, but now every SpaceLiving resident has one in their spaceship.)
<br />It was something like a bathroom box but it was glued to the spaceship walls like it was built along with the spaceship.
<br />It was blue and the thicker part of the LST was dark blue, its plastic door had a lighter blue, and its plastic background had an even lighter blue.
<br />That teleporter could teleport him back to Earth whenever he wanted to.
<br />To see his family, and to know about what was happening on Earth.
<br />To teleport to Earth using the LST teleporter, a resident of the spaceship would need to send an LST synchronization request to a trusted house.
<br />You can select a house by choosing its location on Earth, or using a social media profile from one of the persons that live on the trusted house.
<br />Like your parents, you can send an LST sync request to them and they will receive a hologram message to accept the request.
<br />Then, if they accept, a little robot would fall from a satellite built by TOTB, it would fall close to the trusted house.
<br />It would go inside the house and choose a good location for the LST teleporter, it would then disintegrate and would generate the LST using its separated parts.
<br />The resident has the choice to open the LST door or not when arriving at the trusted house.
<br />If the house was thought to be trusted but is not, then the resident can press the emergency button to teleport back to their LonelyShip.
<br />He could also teleport to the spaceships of other LonelyShippers, the residents of the SpaceLiving SpaceShip Network.
<br />Ted could just enter inside the teleporter, close the door, and type the Discord nick and discriminator of the person on the LST's keyboard.
<br />Then his spaceship would send a teleport request to the person that owned that spaceship.
<br />If the person accepted, then a blue light would appear inside the teleporter, and Ted would go to the selected spaceship.
<br />He was also on the official Discord server of the SpaceLiving Network.
<br />Ted was a little famous in the city that he lived before being teleported to a LonelyShip.
<br />He was famous because the people on Earth knew about the LonelyShippers and the SpaceLiving Network.
<br />But they never had seen a LonelyShipper that came back to Earth, they thought that everyone was stuck on their spaceships and could never leave.
<br />Sometimes Ted teleported back to Earth to visit his family and see how his city was evolving, he was happy to see his city get bigger.
<br />The city that Ted was born was Los Angeles, in California.
<br />He liked his life, he was still a civilian on Earth but he liked more to spend some time on his LonelyShip.
<br />
<br />One day he was sat on the chair of his super-fast computer, eating some lasagna with a cup of Coca-cola while watching a live stream of the Youtuber Cellbit on Twitch.
<br />(YouTube is a website where you can watch videos and upload videos too, there are lots of gameplay videos, songs, makeup, fun videos, animation, movies.)
<br />(Twitch is a website where you can watch the live stream, the majority of them are of gaming, but there's also chat, instruments, song Livestreams, trips, react.)
<br />After eating and waiting thirty minutes, he got up and grabbed a bottle of water on the TPF fridge, then placed the bottle on top of the table at the right of his mouse.
<br />Ted dragged the live stream window to his second screen, the Twitch website where he was watching the live stream was open on the Mozilla Firefox web browser.
<br />(Mozilla Firefox is a web browser where you can navigate the Internet.)
<br />The screen where Twitch was open was the right screen, Ted opened a new window of Mozilla Firefox and opened the Netflix website.
<br />(Netflix is a website and mobile app where you can watch series, movies, cartoons, and anime online, using a paid plan.)
<br />Ted took a look at the catalog, he did not found anything that he was interested to watch at the moment.
<br />Then he closed the browser windows, Ted opened the Steam gaming platform to play some games, he opened Terraria to play.
<br />(Steam is software where you can download free and paid games to play on your computer.)
<br />Ted played on a multiplayer server, he played for thirty minutes, finished building his house, and got a better pickax too.
<br />After playing for a while, he closed the game.
<br />The boy missed his family and his life on Earth, it has been some months since he was on Earth.
<br />Ted turned off his computer and opened the door of the LST teleporter, he wore some slippers and entered inside the teleporter.
<br />Then he closed the door and selected "Planet Earth" on the screen that the teleporter had.
<br />The image and name of the Planet Earth got bigger, it showed a house image on the bottom and the location of the house of Ted's parents was written at the right of it.
<br />He clicked again on the house image, confirming his choice.
<br />Then a blue light appeared on the bottom of the LST teleporter, a sound was being emitted, going up in pitch.
<br />Ted could only see the light, not the interior of his spaceship, after some seconds, the sound stopped and he was inside the LST teleporter of the house of his parents.
<br />The Earth LST was in the kitchen of Ted's parents' house.
<br />His parents were eating, they got up to see Ted, Ted opened the LST's door and got outside of it.
<br />Ted's parents hugged him, smiling and saying they missed him, the trio got a little emotional.
<br />After that, the parents of Ted came back to the kitchen table, sitting, they invited Ted to eat with them.
<br />Then they ate lunch, Ted's parents said that they were going to the market to buy some things.
<br />The father of Ted was called John, his mother was called Ana.
<br />Ted said that he was going downtown, his parents left the house.
<br />He remembered about a sister that he had while he was very young, he disappeared from his house at a very young age.
<br />Ted does not know how that happened, he does not remember, he feels sad for leaving his family like that.
<br />He wanted to find his sister again, to meet her and say that he is sorry.
<br />The boy wanted to see a friend of his, he did not know if that person lived in Los Angeles.
<br />He only talked with that friend through the Internet, he never saw that person in real life.
<br />But he knew that friend did not live inside a LonelyShip.
<br />Ted grabbed a backpack with things like water, food, and put it on his back.
<br />He locked the house and walked outside.
<br />
<br />After walking a little, Ted arrived downtown, he had brought the smartphone that he had on his spaceship.
<br />Ted met that friend two years ago on the Internet, he met that friend on Discord.
<br />(Discord is a social network platform for gamers but non-gamers also use it.)
<br />His friend was a girl called Monika, she had eighteen years old and had brown hair.
<br />Ted sent a message to Monika asking where she lived, he said that he was on Earth.
<br />Monika sent her address to Ted, Ted thought he would need a taxi, an Uber, or something like that to be able to visit her.
<br />He thought that she lived in another city, the parents of Ted lived in Los Angeles, California.
<br />To his surprise, Monika lived in Los Angeles too.
<br />Monika was happy that she was finally going to meet her virtual friend.
<br />Ted caught a bus to go there, he arrived there and knocked on the door.
<br />Monika opened the door for him and let him in, she told him to feel at home.
<br />"Hello, I'm Ted, your virtual friend from Discord," said Ted, smiling while blushing at Monika.
<br />"Hey, so you're Ted, I'm Monika, nice to meet in person, hehe," said Monika, smiling too.
<br />"I... Already saw a picture of you, but... You're even more beautiful in person..." said Ted, blushing.
<br />Monika blushed and looked away, "Thanks Ted..." said her, smiling while blushing.
<br />Then Ted walked around the living room and sat on the couch.
<br />"Hey, do you want some water?" asked Monika, smiling.
<br />"Yes, please," replied Ted, smiling too.
<br />Then Monika closed the door and walked to the kitchen, she grabbed a glass and filled it with water, then walked back to the living room.
<br />Ted drank the water and then gave the glass to Monika.
<br />"Thanks," said Ted.
<br />"No problem, hehe," said Monika.
<br />She walked to the kitchen and left the glass on top of the sink.
<br />
<br />Then Monika walked back to the living room, sitting on the couch and looking at Ted.
<br />"So, you know that I live in a LonelyShip, right?" asked Ted.
<br />"Yes, you told me that some days after we started talking," replied Monika.
<br />"Okay, Hmm..." said Ted, thinking a little, looking at the floor, "I... Like you... I started to like you some months ago Monika...
<br />You're interesting, smart, you like to play piano, to program in Python... And to read, you like literature...
<br />I like all those things too, you even helped me with my code one day, and... I'm speaking too much, aren't I?" asked Ted.
<br />"No, it's okay, hehe," said Monika, who leaned close to Ted and hugged him, giving him a long kiss on his lips with her eyes closed.
<br />Ted was surprised and shocked by that, he blushed a lot while feeling Monika's mouth touching his, he closed his eyes and hugged Monika back, enjoying the kiss.
<br />After some minutes, Monika broke from the kiss and leaned back, smiling while looking at Ted.
<br />"I wanted to tell you this since I met you... Since I started loving you, you're such a good friend," said Ted, smiling.
<br />"Yes, you're a good friend too, Ted.
<br />It's incredible how time goes fast... We know each other for two years already Ted!" said Monika smiling happily.
<br />"Oh... Really?... I love you, Monika... Thanks for being here for me... Thanks for always helping me.
<br />Our friendship is incredible, right? Two years... Who would have thought..." said Ted looking at the floor while thinking.
<br />"I love you too..." said Monika smiling.
<br />"Do you want to be my girlfriend?" asked Ted, smiling.
<br />"Of course you silly!" said Monika, jumping on Ted's arms and hugging him tightly.
<br />Ted started caressing Monika's beautiful light brown hair, smiling and feeling her smell.
<br />"Do you want to live in a LonelyShip with me, honey?" asked Ted.
<br />"Of course, hehe," said Monika, smiling.
<br />"Then you have to go to my house because the LST teleporter is there, hehe," said Ted smiling while looking at Monika.
<br />"What is the LST teleporter honey?" asked Monika, curious.
<br />"It is the LonelyShip Teleporter, it lets you teleport between the LonelyShips and also teleport to Earth.
<br />It is a test of the Think Outside The Box company or TOTB, they're sending this teleporter to people to fix some bugs and errors that it has.
<br />It's not an official thing.
<br />I was one of the people that received the teleporter in their spaceships, so I can use it to go back to Earth whenever I want," explained Ted.
<br />"Oh, that's cool honey, let's go there, but first I have to call my sister, she said that she wanted to live here in Los Angeles.
<br />So I'll transfer the house to her name, and she will pay the bills, okay?" asked Monika.
<br />"Okay honey," said Ted.
<br />Then Monika grabbed her smartphone and sent a message to her sister Sayori, saying that she is going to move to another house.
<br />That Sayori can stay with the house if she pays the bills, Monika said that she is going to get her stuff and leave today.
<br />Sayori said that she wanted to stay with the house, she said that she is going to do a trip tomorrow to bring her stuff, she lived in another city.
<br />
<br />"I told her that I'm moving today, and she said that she is going to bring her stuff here tomorrow.
<br />I'm gonna transfer the house to her name after tomorrow after she moves in.
<br />Do you want to help me pack up my stuff so we can bring it to your house honey?" asked Monika.
<br />"You don't need that honey, the LonelyShip is going to teleport everything that you own when you teleport to the LonelyShip.
<br />The LonelyShip can teleport clothes, smartphones, hard drive data from your computer, USB sticks, pets, and other personal stuff.
<br />The teleporter is small, only two people can fit inside, and..." said Ted, unsure about something.
<br />"Oh, okay, so we just need to teleport to the spaceship right? And?..." asked Monika
<br />"Yes, and... I'm not sure if the LonelyShip will detect that you're there and that you want to live with me.
<br />The spaceship has only stuff for one person, one fridge, one computer, one wardrobe, one bed.
<br />But the LonelyShip knows a lot about feelings, love, and friendship, so maybe it will detect that you want to live with me," said Ted, a little unsure of what he was saying.
<br />"Oh... So we will have only one bed right?" asked Monika looking at Ted with a naughty face.
<br />"Monika, you naughty girl, hehe," said Ted smiling while blushing.
<br />"Hehe, we'll sleep together if the spaceship does not detect our love, right?" said Monika while giggling a little.
<br />"Yes, hehe," said Ted, smiling.
<br />
<br />(I wrote this chapter on 24/11/2019.
<br />And finished revising it on 27/04/2021.
<br />
<br />The adventures of Ted and Monika will continue in the next chapter.
<br />I liked to write about Ted, writing about his parents, and his fame for being a LonelyShipper that can go to Earth.
<br />And I liked writing that Ted has a sister who is a certain someone... I don't know, hehe.
<br />Someone that is also the child of parents named John and Mary...
<br />Thank you for reading this chapter of SpaceLiving, hehe ^^.)

In the last chapter, Ted traveled to Earth to visit his parents, it has been some months since he visited Earth.
<br />He visited his virtual friend Monika in person for the first time, he was so happy.
<br />Ted declared his love for Monika, Monika said she loved him too, they became a couple.
<br />The boy lived in a LonelyShip alone, he wanted to live inside his LonelyShip with his new girlfriend.
<br />The girl accepted his invite, they would live inside Ted's LonelyShip together.
<br />Monika said that her sister wanted to live in Los Angeles, the city that Monika lives in.
<br />She told her sister, Sayori, that she was going to move outside Los Angeles, and said that Sayori could stay with her house.
<br />Monika said that she was moving today, Sayori told Monika that she is going to move her stuff there tomorrow.
<br />The girl would transfer the house's ownership to Sayori after she moves in tomorrow.
<br />The couple only needed to teleport to Ted's LonelyShip, the spaceship would teleport Monika's stuff to there, her clothes and other personal stuff.
<br />In this chapter...
<br />
<br />"So, let's go to your house honey," said Monika, smiling.
<br />"Okay cutie, hehe," said Ted, smiling too.
<br />Then Monika closed the house, she sent a message to Sayori saying that she was leaving the house.
<br />Sayori replied saying okay, she started to pack her things in her house that was in another city.
<br />Ted and Monika started walking to Ted's house.
<br />After some minutes of walking, they arrived there, Ted's parents were home already.
<br />"Hey, son, who is this?" asked John, the father of Ted.
<br />"Hey dad, mom, this is... My girlfriend, Monika, I already told you guys about her.
<br />But... She was my friend back then," said Ted while blushing a little, talking low, feeling happy when introducing his girlfriend to his parents.
<br />"Oh, congratulations son, my name is John," said John, smiling, happy that his son got a girlfriend.
<br />The mother of Ted, Ana, walked close to Monika, she smiled and held her hand, "Nice to meet you, I'm Ana," said her, smiling, proud to have a daughter-in-law.
<br />"Nice to meet you, Ana," said Monika while smiling.
<br />Ana smiled while looking at Monika.
<br />"Nice to meet you, John," said Monika while looking at him.
<br />"Nice to meet you too," said John, smiling.
<br />"So, dad, we're moving to my LonelyShip, it's been a pleasure to see you two again, I love you two," said Ted, who hugged his mother, then his father.
<br />Ana and John returned Ted's hug.
<br />"Good trip son," said Ana, "Travel safe".
<br />"Good trip my boy," said John.
<br />Then Ted walked close to the LST teleporter that existed in the kitchen of the house of Ted's parents, Monika was following him.
<br />He opened the LST's door and entered inside it, Monika did the same, it was six PM.
<br />Ted typed his LonelyShip code which was #512, a blue light appeared on the floor of the LST teleporter.
<br />
<br />After some seconds, Ted and Monika were inside Ted's LonelyShip.
<br />Monika saw Ted's LonelyShip in a photo that he sent to her, but she never saw it in person.
<br />She was really happy seeing it, it had beautiful blue walls, a blue TPF Fridge, a blue LST teleporter, a blue wardrobe, a blue computer desk, and a blue bed with a blue bed-sheet.
<br />Everything was blue, Ted liked the color blue, it was the default color for the fridge and LST teleporter, he changed the wall colors and the other things that were white-colored.
<br />Changing the wall color of the LonelyShip was a feature that was in test by TOTB, Ted received that feature to test.
<br />It also had a bathroom, a laser gun outside the LonelyShip, and a treadmill that was inside the wall but could go out when it was going to be used.
<br />The LonelyShip started to move a little, Ted held on to Monika so he would not shake, he did not know what was happening.
<br />After some minutes, the spaceship created a copy of Ted's LonelyShip, that copy was connected physically with Ted's spaceship.
<br />Now Ted's LonelyShip is a LovelyShip, not Lonely anymore, now there is two of everything, two beds, wardrobes, computers, chairs, TPF Fridges, bathrooms, and LST Teleporters.
<br />Monika walked to her bed and laid on it, enjoying the fluffiness of the mattress.
<br />Monika's side of the LovelyShip was green colored, but it was a dark green, not bad for the eyes.
<br />Everything was green, green, and blue, Ted liked that color combination.
<br />"I never laid in a bed so fluffy, hehe," said Monika smiling.
<br />"This is incredible honey, I would never think about something like this, I love being in here with you," continued her, smiling while looking at Ted, moving on the bed.
<br />Monika was happy, she got off the bed and walked to her tall window, she could see the Earth from far away, the moon too, the sun was on Ted's window.
<br />"Yes, it is incredible honey, I love to live inside my LonelyShip, it makes me calm, makes me feel like I have my place to spend some time alone.
<br />And now you're here, now I don't need to feel lonely anymore," said Ted, who walked close to Monika and started looking at Earth with Monika, hugging her.
<br />"Aww honey, you're so cute," said Monika, who squeezed Ted's cheek softly and kissed it.
<br />"Hehe, so, do you wanna learn anything about the LovelyShip honey?" asked Ted.
<br />"Yes, how does the TPF Fridge work?" asked Monika, curious.
<br />Ted walked to Monika's TPF Fridge while holding her hand.
<br />"The food and beverage generated by the TPF are nutrients, so if you eat a pizza, you don't need to feel guilty, they are just nutrients, not lots of cheese.
<br />You can think about some food or beverage and the TPF will generate it for you," explained Ted, who opened the door of the TPF while thinking of a slice of pizza on a plate.
<br />There was a slice of pizza on top of a plate inside the fridge.
<br />"And you can also remove food if you don't want it anymore," said Ted, not wanting the pizza slice anymore, closing the TPF, and opening it again.
<br />The pizza slice was no more, and the plate disappeared.
<br />"Oh, that's really interesting honey! I'll never get hungry this way," said Monika, smiling while looking at the TPF fridge.
<br />"You'll get hungry, but it's far easier to get food with the fridge, you don't need to cook, you can eat on time, hehe," said Ted, smiling.
<br />"Yeah, hehe, thanks for teaching me this honey," said Monika, smiling.
<br />"No problem my cutie, so, wanna give it a try?" asked Ted.
<br />"Yes," said Monika, who thought about a cheesecake, then she opened the fridge, there was a cheesecake inside the fridge.
<br />"That's incredible, hehe," said Monika smiling.
<br />"Yeah, hehe," said Ted, who walked to his side of the LovelyShip, lying on his bed.
<br />
<br />"Hey honey, let's watch a movie," said Monika looking at Ted, she closes the TPF and thought about a plate, a fork, and a knife.
<br />"Okay hon, I'm gonna open Netflix," said Ted, who got up and sat on his computer chair, he turned his computer on.
<br />Monika opened the TPF Fridge and there was an empty gray plate of ceramic with a fork and a knife on top of it.
<br />Ted opened the Mozilla Firefox web browser on his computer and opened the Netflix website.
<br />(Netflix is a website and mobile app where you can watch series, movies, cartoons, and anime online, using a paid plan.)
<br />He chose a movie called "Little Manhattan" from 2005 to watch, he put the movie on full screen.
<br />A hole formed on the wall behind the screens of the computers of the couple.
<br />The screens of both Ted's computer and Monika's computer entered inside the hole.
<br />After that, the hole closed itself, like pistons were moving inside it.
<br />Then a big and wide screen appeared from the inside of a hole that formed on the wall.
<br />The big screen was high on the wall, the couple could lay on the bed and watch the movie from far away.
<br />The screen was big enough so they could see the details of the remastered 4K version of the movie.
<br />Ted left the movie on pause and waited for Monika to come to watch it.
<br />Monika grabbed the gray plate and the fork, she cut a slice of the cheesecake for her.
<br />Then she grabbed the knife and left it on top of the plate with the fork, she closed the fridge's door and thought about a can of Coca-cola.
<br />After that, there was a Coca-cola can inside the fridge, Monika grabbed it and the plate with the slice of cheesecake, she sat on her bed with the food and drink.
<br />Ted got up and opened his TPF fridge, he grabbed a hamburger on top of a plate from the inside of it and a can of Coca-cola.
<br />Then he sat on the bed, a TV controller appeared from inside of the wall and landed on top of Ted's computer table.
<br />Ted grabbed it and sat on the bed again, the LovelyShip's Artificial Intelligence moved the beds close to each other, so Monika and Ted could watch the movie close together.
<br />
<br />After that, Ted pressed play on the TV controller and relaxed on his bed.
<br />The couple started to eat and drink while watching the movie, Little Manhattan, which was a romance and drama movie.
<br />Monika and Ted smiled seeing the love of Gabe, the main character, for Rosemary, an eleven-year-old girl.
<br />In half of the movie, Monika and Ted already finished eating their food and drinking their Coca-colas.
<br />After one hour and fifty minutes, the movie ended, the main character did not date the girl at the end of the movie.
<br />The couple got sad because of that, but they were happy because Gabe's parents reconciled with each other.
<br />Monika and Ted hugged each other and closed their eyes, relaxing with each other.
<br />Monika had never watched that movie before, she liked it, Ted already watched it before, he wanted to show the movie to Monika.
<br />Ted got up and exited the full-screen mode of the web browser using the ESC key of his computer keyboard.
<br />A hole formed behind the big screen and the screen entered inside the hole.
<br />Then the screens of Ted's and Monika's computer were back.
<br />
<br />Ted looked at the hours on his computer screen, the hours were at the inferior right side of the screen.
<br />It was 11:00 PM, Ted and Monika were a little tired.
<br />"So, do you want to sleep with me honey?" asked Monika with a naughty face.
<br />"Of course hon, hehe," said Ted, smiling naughtily.
<br />Then Monika got up and placed her Coca-cola can, the empty plate, fork, and knife inside the TPF fridge.
<br />She did not want the cheesecake anymore, so she closed the TPF's door, she opened the door again, the cheesecake was no more, the plate was gone too.
<br />Ted did the same, placing his empty plate inside the TPF fridge and closing it.
<br />Then he turned his computer off and used the bathroom.
<br />The LovelyShip's bathroom and the bathroom of all LonelyShips had a laser toilet that melted everything inside when you pressed the flush button.
<br />Ted got out of the bathroom and looked at Monika, smiling.
<br />Monika got up, "I wish there was a way for us to sleep together, and not like these two beds close to each other," said her, looking a little sad.
<br />Then a hole formed below the two beds, making them fall softly inside of the spaceship, a double bed got out of the hole, and it was closed.
<br />Ted found that very technological, he laid on top of the double bed and smiled at Monika again.
<br />"The spaceship knows what you're feeling hon," said him.
<br />"Hehe, it is so good and caring, feels like a mother, a mother that wants their children happy and comfortable," said Monika, smiling while looking at the ceiling.
<br />Then Monika laid beside Ted and hugged him tightly, kissing his lips, the couple closed their eyes, relaxing on the double bed.
<br />"I think it's gonna take some time for me to get used to living in here.
<br />But... With you here, it makes everything easier, I know you'll help me, hehe.
<br />And I want to live with you here, I want to stay by your side forever hon because you're the one that I love," said Monika, smiling happily while looking at Ted.
<br />"Aww, hon... That makes me so happy, I want to stay by your side forever too, I love you a lot, I'm not lonely anymore, now that I have your..." said Ted, who kissed Monika's lips.
<br />"Hmm, hehe, me too, I love you so much, hon!" said Monika, who hugged Ted tight, closing her eyes.
<br />Ted also closed his eyes, smiling happily while hugging Monika.
<br />The LovelyShip's AI turned the LovelyShip's lights off automatically, feeling that the couple was going to sleep.
<br />They slept on a warm night, but not too hot, the LovelyShip's temperature system was synchronized with their body's temperature, creating a cozy environment to sleep.
<br />
<br />(I love to write about Monika and Ted's adventure, it was so good, made me so happy.
<br />I don't remember when I wrote this chapter, but I know it was in 2019.
<br />I finished revising it on 28/04/2021, it was so good, hehe.
<br />Thank you for reading this chapter ^^.)

SpaceLiving, Chapter Six, The SpaceShip update and the reunion of brothers.
<br />*A message appears on the screen where you are reading this story...*
<br />*The message was from the enterprise Think Outside The Box that created the LonelyShips and the SpaceLiving Network.*
<br />It says:
<br />"SpaceLiving SpaceShip Network, Update number 1.3.709.
<br />A new update to the LonelyShips has been made, it brings wall color changes.
<br />Requests of changes of equipment, and the possibility of making a double LonelyShip.
<br />Now you can come close to your bed and raise your hand, a new mechanical-physical menu will appear.
<br />You can choose the new color of the walls, bed, table, TPF Fridge, and other stuff.
<br />And you can request a change of equipment too, like, you see a new screen that has 144hz refresh rate on the Internet.
<br />Then you get closer to your screen and raise your hand, a new button will appear close to it.
<br />That button is called "Change Equipment", your can change your screen, computer case or video games.
<br />Or you can use the "SpaceLiving Equipment Changer" Extension for Mozilla Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and other web browsers.
<br />You can also do that on the SpaceLiving Store App for desktops, it comes installed on your computer by default, along with an installation of a modified version of Windows 10.
<br />Some users are receiving a new device that we created called the "LonelyShip Teleporter" or LST, you can use it to go back to Earth if you want.
<br />(This teleporter did not exist in older versions of the LonelyShip, but now every SpaceLiving resident has one in their spaceship.)
<br />To teleport to Earth using the LST teleporter, you would need to send an LST synchronization request to a trusted house.
<br />You can select a house by choosing its location on Earth, or using a social media profile from one of the persons that live on the trusted house.
<br />Like your parents, you can send an LST sync request to them and they will receive a hologram message to accept the request.
<br />Then, if they accept, a little robot would fall from a satellite built by TOTB, it would fall close to the trusted house.
<br />It would go inside the house and choose a good location for the LST teleporter, it would then disintegrate and would generate the LST using its separated parts.
<br />The resident has the choice to open the LST door or not when arriving at the trusted house.
<br />If the house was thought to be trusted but is not, then the resident can press the emergency button to teleport back to their LonelyShip.
<br />Also, you can now invite people to your LonelyShip, to live there with you, it will transform the ship into a Double-LonelyShip.
<br />You can use the LST to go to Earth and ask a person to join your LonelyShip. 
<br />If you and this person use the LST at the same time, and the person wants to live in your LonelyShip.
<br />Then the spaceship will begin to change, move and add plus one of everything that you have, it will be a copy of your side of the LonelyShip.
<br />White walls, super-fast computer, TPF, the LST, bathroom, bed, wardrobe, the default things that come on every LonelyShip.
<br />The Artificial Intelligence of the LonelyShip will change the name of the spaceship depending on the relationship between you and your spaceship partner.
<br />If your partner and you are in a romantic relationship, then the spaceship will be called LovelyShip.
<br />If you and your partner are friends, it will be called a FriendShip.
<br />You can also join the Discord server of SpaceLiving, join the server at $spaceliving_discord_join_link.
<br />This is the end of the change-log for the LonelyShips, this was written by Think Outside The Box, defend yourself from the asteroids, stay safe, take care, and be lonely! :)".
<br />*The message disappears...*
<br />
<br />A LonelyShipper was seeing this message, he was in his LonelyShip, the walls of his LonelyShip had the orange color.
<br />The name of that LonelyShipper was Izaque.
<br />He loved his LonelyShip, Izaque loved to listen to some Dubstep in his LonelyShip, blasting it on the speakers.
<br />Izaque also made some live streams on Twitch, showing what he was doing to his subscribers.
<br />He liked to download songs from the SoundCloud website, to play games on Steam.
<br />To write stories and post them on Wattpad, Fanfiction, and in the websites that he made by himself, making them on the PHP and HTML languages.
<br />One day, Izaque was reading a really good and atmospheric story on the FimFiction website.
<br />It was about the My Little Pony cartoon and the Don't Starve game together, it was a crossover.
<br />He liked so much those two things, the game, and the cartoon, and those things together are better than them alone.
<br />There was one day where Izaque did not make a live stream, he was watching a movie called Avengers: Infinity War.
<br />Izaque was eating pizzas, hamburgers, and lots of Coca-cola cups while watching the two-hour movie.
<br />He loved to do that, watch that awesome movie, Izaque added the movie to his watched list on his website called Watch History.
<br />The boy added the movie on his website and movie text files on his computer using a Python script called Watch.py that he made.
<br />Izaque also used a program on his computer called Foobar2000, which was a Music Player, Izaque had 25 GBs of music on his SSD hard drive.
<br />He liked to have a lot of music stored on his SSD, and he called himself a Music Hoarder.
<br />Izaque was also a friend of one of the founders of Think Outside The Box, he liked the new update they made to the LonelyShips.
<br />The Double-Ship possibility, wall color change, LonelyShip Invite, and the equipment change, he liked all the new changes and new features.
<br />Izaque sure loved to be a LonelyShipper and to live in a LonelyShip, to live on the SpaceLiving SpaceShip Network.
<br />He even created a Discord Server about it and talked to a lot of friends on Discord about how to become a LonelyShipper.
<br />The boy wanted people to feel the happiness that he felt on his LonelyShip.
<br />
<br />One day, Izaque had an asteroid coming in the direction of his LonelyShip, then the security system activated and a big laser turret appeared at the top of his LonelyShip.
<br />It shot its laser beam towards the asteroid, destroying the asteroid completely.
<br />Izaque was not scared by the asteroid, because he knew how the LonelyShip would protect him from the asteroid.
<br />He loved to study and to learn about the LonelyShips, SpaceLiving, and the Think Outside The Box company.
<br />With the new update number 1.3.709, Izaque and the other LonelyShippers could visit their families, they were happy to see them again.
<br />Lisa did not want to see her family, she thought they would be sad about her, and missed her.
<br />But she got some courage and walked to her LST teleporter, she entered inside it and selected the location of the house of her parents.
<br />Her parents accepted her LST synchronization request, an LST teleporter was created inside Lisa's parents' house.
<br />Lisa selected her parents' house on the LST screen, she teleported there to see her family again.
<br />Her parents were there, they started crying when they saw her there, they walked close to her to hug her.
<br />Lisa hugged her parents back, she thought about her brother.
<br />"First your brother comes back, and now you, I'm so happy my little flower," said Lisa's father, John.
<br />"My brother was here?" asked her.
<br />"Yes, he has been here some months ago, he started dating that girl that he told us, Monika, right honey?" asked John to Ana, Lisa's mother.
<br />"Yeah, he started dating her, then they started living in his... What was that, hon? I can't remember that name," said Ana.
<br />"It was some type of spaceship I think, they could live there together in space," said John, unsure of what he was saying.
<br />"Spaceship?" asked Lisa in a surprised voice, she thought about something.
<br />"I have to go back right now," said Lisa.
<br />"Why? You just arrived my little flower," asked John.
<br />"It's that maybe my brother lives on the same spaceship network that I live.
<br />And I'm sorry that I didn't get good grades, and never made you two proud of me, I'm sorry dad, mom.
<br />I'm sorry that I stopped going to school, and I was just locked inside my room, crying, I did want to eat anything," said Lisa, with a sad face.
<br />"Oh, it's okay my dear, we love you, even if you don't have good grades, and don't go to school," said Ana, hugging Lisa.
<br />"Yeah, we love you, Lisa," said John, who also hugged Lisa.
<br />"Now go find your brother, hehe," said Ana, smiling at Lisa.
<br />Lisa smiled again, looking at her father and her mother, "What is my brother's name?" asked Lisa.
<br />"Oh, it's Ted," said Ana.
<br />"Okay, thanks mom, dad, I love your two," said Lisa, who started walking to the LST teleporter of Lisa's parents.
<br />"We love you too," said Ana and John together, waving their hands to Lisa.
<br />Then Lisa entered the LST teleporter, she typed the code of her LonelyShip, which was #324.
<br />
<br />She came back to her LonelyShip, she got out of her LST teleporter and walked to her computer, turning it on.
<br />Lisa waited for the computer to boot, then she opened the Discord program, she also opened the SpaceLiving App on her computer.
<br />(Discord is a social network platform for gamers but non-gamers also use it.)
<br />The girl looked on the SpaceLiving App, searching for the invite link to the official Discord server of the SpaceLiving Network.
<br />She entered the Discord server and said hello on the main chat, then she clicked on the role chat.
<br />Lisa got some roles like wall color roles, additional things, furniture colors, the code of her LonelyShip, which was #324.
<br />She had the Blue Wall Color, Blue Furniture Color, and #512 roles.
<br />The girl started looking on the member list of the server, she was searching for her brother, Ted.
<br />The nickname of every LonelyShipper was their name on the Discord server.
<br />On Discord, you can have a username like Izaque, and a code or discriminator like #5125.
<br />Someone can add you on Discord by combining your username and your discriminator, like Izaque#5125.
<br />On Discord servers, you can change your username only on that server, that is called a nickname.
<br />So Lisa could have a username like LisaLS and a nickname like Lisa.
<br />She found the Discord profile of her brother, Ted, she clicked on it and sent him a friend request.
<br />After some minutes, he accepted the friend request, he said hello to Lisa.
<br />Lisa got up and grabbed a water bottle from her TPF fridge, she then sat at the chair of her computer, drinking some of the water.
<br />The girl put some calm music on the YouTube website to play.
<br />"Hello, how are you?" asked Lisa to Ted.
<br />"I'm good, how about you, Lisa?" asked Ted.
<br />"I'm good too, thanks for asking.
<br />Can I ask something a little personal?" asked Lisa.
<br />"Sure, go on," said Ted.
<br />"Okay... Do you have a sister?" asked Lisa.
<br />"Yes, I have one, though I don't remember her very well, how she was, it's been some time since I and her disappeared from the house of our parents.
<br />And it has been some time since I saw my parents too, some months ago, I was there at their house, I want to see my sister again," said Ted.
<br />"Oh, okay... Do you remember the name of your sister? Or how her appearance was?" asked Lisa.
<br />"No... I think she had gray hair, why?" asked Ted.
<br />"Just asking," said Lisa, "So... I think I'm your sister," said Lisa.
<br />"What? How?" asked Ted.
<br />"My dad's name is John, and my mom's name is Ana, they said that my brother's name was Ted," said Lisa.
<br />"Oh, is that true? Hm... Can I see a picture of you? I remember that my sister had gray hair..." asked Ted.
<br />"Okay, here it is," said Lisa, who sent Ted a photo of her.

<br />"I can't believe it... Is that you? Lisa? Hm... Can I visit your LonelyShip?" asked Ted.
<br />"Okay..." said Lisa, who sent her LonelyShip code to Ted.
<br />
<br />Then Ted walked to his LST teleporter, he got inside of it and typed Lisa's LonelyShip's code.
<br />After some seconds, he was on the LST teleporter of Lisa's LonelyShip, he opened the door and got out.
<br />"Hello... Lisa, sis," said Ted, looking at Lisa.
<br />Lisa got up and walked to Ted, she hugged him, "Brother..." said her, with her eyes closed.
<br />"Sis..." said Ted, hugging Lisa back, caressing her hair.
<br />After that, Lisa broke from the hug, "I remember mom saying something about us having two other sisters, do you remember that?" asked Ted.
<br />"Yes, I don't remember how they were, maybe they were too young when we disappeared right?" asked Lisa, who sat at the bed.
<br />"Yeah... I wish I could see them again, last time I was home they said that one of them moved to another city.
<br />And that the other one was still in Los Angeles," said Ted, who also sat at the bed.
<br />"Oh, I wanted to see them again, maybe we should go home and try to find them, ask mom and dad, what do you think brother?" asked Lisa.
<br />"I think that's a great idea sis, hehe, let's do it in a few weeks, okay?" asked Ted.
<br />"Okay, hehe," said Lisa, Ted hugged her again, "I'm so happy to see you again," said Ted.
<br />"Me too, brother," said Lisa, smiling.
<br />"I'm sorry that I stopped going to school, and started getting depressed, sad, just locked inside my room, and didn't want to eat," said Lisa with a sad face.
<br />"It's okay sis... I should have tried more, to help you, I was weak... I'm sorry that I didn't help you..." said Ted, also sad.
<br />"No, it's okay brother... it was me that was weak, and didn't notice the state that I was in, I should have tried more to make you, dad, and mom happy..." said Lisa.
<br />"It's okay... I think you're better now, you received this gift, which is this LonelyShip, and you can live better here, and I'm happy for you, I love you, sis," said Ted.
<br />"I love you too, brother, hehe," said Lisa, they were still hugging.
<br />"Aren't you gonna tell me about your girlfriend?" asked Lisa.
<br />"Oh, yes, hehe, she is called Monika, and she has brown hair, she is very cute and I love her.
<br />I met her on Discord, hehe, some years after I got teleported to my LonelyShip," said Ted.
<br />"Can I meet her?" asked Lisa.
<br />"Sure, hehe, how about tomorrow?" asked Ted.
<br />"Tomorrow sounds great, hehe," said Lisa.
<br />"Okay, hehe, I'm gonna go back to my LonelyShip okay sis?
<br />Monika left the LonelyShip to visit her parents in Los Angeles and to transfer her house to her sister.
<br />I'm gonna go to Earth to visit mom and dad, today is the day of visiting your parents, hehe, because of the new LonelyShip update," said Ted.
<br />"Okay brother, tell mom and dad that we met each other again and that we want to find our two sisters," said Lisa.
<br />"Okay, I'm gonna do that sis," said Ted, getting up and walking to Lisa's LST teleporter, he opened the door.
<br />"Goodbye, sis," said Ted.
<br />"Goodbye, brother," said Lisa, then Ted entered inside the LST teleporter and typed the code of his LovelyShip, he teleported to there.
<br />Lisa walked to her computer and opened a live stream of the game GTA V to watch.
<br />
<br />Izaque missed his family, he used the LST to make an LST synchronization request, to teleport to his parents' house.
<br />The boy appeared there and hugged all of them, his sisters, his brother, his father, and his mother.
<br />He was used to being on Earth and talking to humans, even if he had spent a lot of time inside his LonelyShip.
<br />Izaque asked if someone wanted to live there with him, but no one wanted, he was sad about that.
<br />Then he said "See you later" to all of them, he walked inside the LST teleporter that was in the house of his parents.
<br />And teleported back to the LonelyShip, a robot female voice greeted him, "Welcome back, Izaque," said the voice.
<br />It was the voice of the LSAI that Izaque had, he changed the gender and name of the default LSAI.
<br />The LonelyShip of Izaque already had a lot of good equipment, a good screen with a 144hz refresh rate, a PS4.
<br />Izaque was happy about his LonelyShip, he liked to eat delicious food from his TPF fridge, watch anime, movies, cartoons, series, videos, and play games on his computer.
<br />He wanted to talk more with Lisa, Bunny, Lyn, and other Discord friends that he had.
<br />The boy wanted to live more inside of his LonelyShip, he had a great life, did not needed to work, had free food and a free computer.
<br />Izaque was a little tired, he listened to some Dubstep music on his computer.
<br />Then watched an episode of the anime Eromanga Sensei while eating chocolate cookies.
<br />Izaque knew that Lisa liked that anime because it reminded her of her older brother.
<br />Lisa told Izaque that she remembered about her brother, visited her parents, and her brother visited her.
<br />Izaque was happy about Lisa, he sent her a message on Discord, he said he was watching Eromanga Sensei.
<br />"I love anime, hehe, hey Izaque...
<br />I think you're a great person and a great friend.
<br />I'm happy to be your friend, hehe, you're gentle and caring.
<br />So... Thanks for being my friend, Izaque, I appreciate it," said Lisa with a smiley emoji.
<br />"Oh? Hehe, thanks, Lisa, I also like to be your friend, I'm very happy and grateful for that.
<br />You're a good friend, and gentle too, you're interesting, creative, and fun, hehe ^^.
<br />I still want to write a story with you, hehe," said Izaque.
<br />"Oh, hehe, we have to write one then, and thank you for all of those compliments ^^," replied Lisa.
<br />"Yes, hehe, I'm gonna go to bed right now, good night, Lisa," said Izaque.
<br />"Good night, Izaque ^^," said Lisa.
<br />He added the episode of Eromanga Sensei to his watched list using his Python script called Watch.py.
<br />Then, Izaque turned off his computer, he laid in his bed to sleep.
<br />The LSAI turned the lights of the LonelyShip off, Izaque started to sleep.

(This is the explanation of a... let me create a cool name for that... a "SpaceLivingTeleportExperience")
<br />It was a beautiful day in the SpaceLiving world, even if there's no sun close to the spaceships.
<br />Lisa, Izaque, Wendy, John, Ted and Monika were all inside their spaceships, living happy and using the computer.
<br />Lisa was drawing a little while watching an anime called "Eromanga Sensei", she felt inspired by that, because it had an girl that drew too.
<br />She was happy drawing while watching her favorite anime, it was funny, cute, happy, she loved it.
<br />The anime tell the story of a little sister that draw erotic drawings, and an older brother that write stories and light novels.
<br />Lisa loved to watch that anime, she was re watching it for the twenty-third time.
<br />She had it download in HD on her computer, just to watch again and again.
<br />The anime reminded her of her older brother, she loved him very much.
<br />But then she got depressed, sad and just wanted to stay in her room, he was sad about that.
<br />She was hungry all day, but didn't had the motivation to eat.
<br />She just stayed on her room, the lights were dimmed out, she was doing things at her computer.
<br />Then she reached a point in her life that she was weak and skinny, she realized that her life was bad.
<br />Lisa wanted to get out of there, she was afraid, she wanted to go to school just to make her parents happy.
<br />Her family was sad about her, she wanted to get out of there, when she slept, was 05:12 in the morning.
<br />She was sleeping in her bed, she had a dream, a dream where she got teleported to a spaceship that had white walls.
<br />A Computer, PS4, a Fridge that creates any food you think about, a bed, a wardrobe, a smartphone on the table.
<br />She thought that was incredible and awesome, to have all the things you need to use the computer.
<br />To have food and water when you want, and to have a super-good computer.
<br />She wanted to stay there forever, her eyes were shining bright.
<br />Everything was new to her, she got closer to the table and turned the computer on by pressing the button on the computer cabinet.
<br />It loaded Windows 10, it was as if she had formatted the computer, she typed the name of the user.
<br />A password, and then the Windows 10 home screen appeared, it had Mozilla Firefox, Spotify, Windows Explorer and the SpaceLiving Desktop App installed.
<br />She opened Firefox, the home page was DuckDuckGo, the favorites of the browser were: DuckDuckGo, YouTube, Facebook, SoundCloud, SuperAnimes, Wattpad, MyAnimeList.
<br />She opened YouTube and logged in her account.
<br />Then Lisa opened DuckDuckGo and download Youtube-DLG, it was an app that she used in her personal computer.
<br />The computer also had Steam installed, Lisa logged in her Steam account.
<br />She opened Windows Explorer, she saw that the computer had 5 SSDs, each one with 10TB of space.
<br />Her eyes shined bright seeing that, because she only had 500GB of HD in her computer.
<br />She switched to Steam and told her to download all the games she had.
<br />Then Lisa opened the Mega website, she logged into her account and downloaded the app, she installed it and put it to download all of her 2TB of files.
<br />She was loving that, setting up and organizing her new space of work.
<br />After letting Steam and Mega do their jobs, Lisa was a little hungry, she got closer to the fridge, and a screen that was attached to it lighted up.
<br />It showed a lot of text, like if it was a tutorial on how to use the fridge, Lisa thought it was pretty intuitive.
<br />She learned how to use the fridge, she thought about pizza, then opened the fridge, and a slice of pizza was there.
<br />Lisa thought it was amazing, she closed the fridge, thought about a coca-cola and opened the fridge.
<br />A can of coca cola was there, she grabbed it and closed the fridge.
<br />She came back to the computer table and laid the pizza and can in the top of the table.
<br />Lisa started organizing her Mega files, she liked to make websites, she had a website were she made a history of what she watched.
<br />She downloaded some anime on a website called SuperAnimes, Lisa had downloaded the first episode of the anime "Eromanga Sensei".
<br />Lisa thought it was interesting, and wanted to give it a try.
<br />She started watching it while eating the pizza and drinking the coca cola, she loved doing that.
<br />Lisa added the episode to her watch history and to her AniCartoMovie.txt file, she cleaned her hands and her mouth.
<br />Then she realized she forgot something, "Discord!, I forgot it", she thought, Lisa downloaded Discord and logged in her account.
<br />She was so happy to download it again, and use it again, she thought that was a dream.
<br />Lisa knew that Google+ was going to die soon, she was sad about that, but she was happy about starting that new but not so new life of hers.
<br />She had a special friend on Google+, that friend was called Funkysnipa Cat or Izaque in real life.
<br />She loved to talk with that friend, she opened Hangouts and asked for his Discord name and id.
<br />Izaque gave it to her, she added him on Discord and they started talking, Lisa wanted to know him more.
<br />They talked a lot, and knew a lot more about each other, Lisa was happy talking with Izaque.
<br />Lisa wanted to express herself better, and write something, she wanted to write words in her computer.
<br />Then she talked with Izaque about that, Izaque suggested for Lisa to start writing stories.
<br />She liked the idea, Izaque said for Lisa to download Notepad++, he said that its a good program for writing.
<br />Lisa downloaded the program and started her first draft of a story, she wrote for some minutes.
<br />She liked the result, then saved the file and sent it to her Mega cloud.
<br />Izaque said for her to post her story on Wattpad, because it was a good platform for writers.
<br />Lisa created an account there and posted her story, the name of the story was "The Odds of Nature".
<br />After waiting some time Lisa reloaded the page and there were 10 views in it, and a comment.
<br />The author of the comment was "stake2", Lisa switched to Discord and asked if Izaque had a Wattpad account.
<br />Izaque said yes, Lisa came back to Firefox to read the comment, stake2 was complimenting the story of Lisa, she was happy about that.
<br />She liked the comment and replied thanking stake2, she was really happy about that comment.
<br />Then Lisa switched to Discord and asked for the link of the account of Izaque on Wattpad.
<br />Izaque sent the link to Lisa, surprisingly was stake2, Lisa was really happy about that.
<br />She switched to Discord to thank Izaque for that, Lisa said she loved to write the first chapter.
<br />Izaque said: "I started like that, well, I wrote Ilha Deserta, I wasn't really happy about that story, it was my first story."
<br />Then Izaque said: "I made Ilha Deserta in 2016, when I was reading a really cool futuristic story, I was happy about the feeling that writing gave me,
<br />then I never stopped till today."
<br />Lisa said: "Oh, I'm happy to know that, I love to write, I will read your story called "Life of Littletato", I liked to know how your started writing,
<br />thanks for teaching me a lot about writing."
<br />Then Izaque said: "I don't know much, but thanks for listening, learning and saying that my knowledge was helpful :), hehe, I like you a lot Lisa :3."
<br />Lisa said: "I like you a lot too Izaque, hehe :3."
<br />Then Steam finished downloading all the games of Lisa, she wanted to play one, she opened Grand Theft Auto 5 to play a little.
<br />She had some mods installed, she loved to play that game, to drive cars and stuff.
<br />Lisa played a little and stopped, she closed the game, she was hungry again, she got up and thought about a hamburger and a coca cola.
<br />She opened the fridge and there was, a hamburger in a plate and a can of coca cola. 
<br />Lisa downloaded an episode of the sixth season of the series "The Walking Dead", she waited for it to be downloaded and opened it in VLC Media Player.
<br />She thought was weird to eat while watching that series, but she couldn't handle her hunger, so she watched while eating.
<br />It was sad to watch that series, sometimes people die, and you end the episode being sad.
<br />She finished watching and eating, she added the episode to her watch history.
<br />She felt tired, and she wanted to use the bathroom, she used it and came to her bed, she laid on her bed and tried to close her eyes.
<br />Lisa thought: "This is really a dream?, it looks very real...", then Lisa tries to pinch herself.
<br />She didn't woke up, she was surprised by that.
<br />Then Lisa slept, waiting to go more at the computer.

[In the last chapter, Lisa was not dreaming, she actually teleported to the SpaceShip, it wasn't a dream]
<br />Another day in the SpaceLiving world, a rumor about a group spaceship was circulating, 4 friends who were so close and knew each other so well.
<br />They were teleported to the spaceship together, this rumor was spreading quickly, the users of the LonelyShips were talking a lot about it.
<br />They created theories and groups, fake Discord accounts about it.
<br />There was also a story, created and written by a user on Discord and Wattpad, called stake2.
<br />It was about the actions and the life of that specific group in their LonelyShip.
<br />The name of the group was... Gang Da Suruba.
<br />Some people thought that stake2 was a resident on the spaceship of Gang Da Suruba(GDS) because the story had many details.
<br />At some time, in 2019 or 2020, I think.
<br />4 friends sent messages in the official SpaceLiving Discord Server.
<br />Their names were Drag, Manuh, Funkysnipa Cat and kendrinhah.
<br />One of the members sent a selfie of the group, it was Manuh.
<br />Manuh and Drag were fighting in the back of the picture.
<br />Kendra was taking the picture and Funkysnipa Cat was just headbanging to dubstep in the bed.
<br />The users that were looking at the chat started to talk about it.
<br />One said: "They are the rare group that was teleported to a LonelyShip!".
<br />John was there too, he said: "Oh, I would like to live in a spaceship with my friends".
<br />Funkysnipa Cat said: "And that is me, headbanging to dubstep in the bed".
<br />Drag said: "I'm fighting in the back of the pic with Manuh".
<br />kendrinhah said: "And I'm taking the pic".
<br />A random user said: "This is the first pic of a spaceship, we never saw a picture of a LonelyShip".
<br />Ted said: "Yea, that's right, someone gotta tell Think Outside The Box".
<br />A SpaceLiving Admin said: "They already know about that, since they have enabled that feature, only for that specific group,
<br />So they should feel special".
<br />Ted said: "Oh, okay then, they should feel happy".
<br />The Admin said: "Yea...".
<br />After some time people stopped talking about them, a member of the group began to stream on Twitch.
<br />Showing his things, how he wrote stories, and surprisingly, Funkysnipa Cat was also stake2.
<br />And the story was real, the story was about the group of Gang Da Suruba.
<br />The people watching asked a lot of questions to stake2, what was his name, he replied that his name was Izaque.
<br />Manuh, Drag, and Kendra entered the room of Izaque, one at a time, to present themselves for Izaque's viewers.
<br />After a while Izaque closed the live stream, he wanted to sleep a little, he closed the door and laid on his bed.
<br />Kendra was sleeping too, Izaque dreamed a little, thinking that he loved to live there with his friends.
<br />On the next day, Izaque woke up and opened his door, he turned on his computer and saw an announcement on the Official SpaceLiving Discord Server.
<br />It was a notification saying that on that day, at 18:00 all LonelyShippers or LonelyShip residents were going to be teleported to a big SpaceShip.
<br />To make a party, also because of that specific event (the GDS group), for the LonelyShippers to know other LonelyShippers.
<br />Izaque told Drag, Kendra, and Manuh about that, Manuh said in Brazilian Portuguese:
<br />"Mas eles n√£o podem simplesmente nos teleportar pra l√°, e se algu√©m n√£o quiser ir?".
<br />("But they can't just simply teleport us to there, and if there's someone who doesn't want to go?").
<br />Izaque said in Brazilian Portuguese: "Bom... eles fizeram isso pra n√≥s trazer pra c√° kk".
<br />("Well... they made that to bring us here xD").
<br />Manuh replied: "At√© que faz sentido" ("Well that makes sense").
<br />After some time, it was 18:00, the LonelyShippers looked at their computer clocks, they suddenly were floating, then all of them appeared on a single spaceship.
<br />Everyone looked at each other, Ted was close to Monika, John smiled at Lisa and Lisa smiled back, Izaque hugged Lisa and Lisa accepted the hug.
<br />Kendra was a little jealous because of that, Izaque then smiled at Wendy and Wendy smiled back.
<br />Manuh told Kendra that if she was her, she would get mad at Wendy and Lisa.
<br />Kendra thought she was not that angry or wasn't so extreme as Manuh.
<br />Izaque talked a little with Lisa, Wendy, John, Ted, Monika, he loved to talk face to face with people he talked through the internet.
<br />Wendy and Lisa were so happy about that, everyone was chatting, it was an awesome sight, a lot of people with lots of stuff in common.
<br />Talking a lot and being in the same environment.
<br />Then a screen appeared in the spaceship, saying:
<br />"This was a meeting planned for some days in the future, but it has been done today because we felt like doing it today.
<br />We, at Think Outside The Box, want to thank all of you, and we want to say that we are so happy to have you here today.
<br />Everyone who participated, everyone who lives inside a LonelyShip, everyone that lives inside a DoubleLonelyShip.
<br />And some specific people... that live inside a... Group SpaceShip :), everyone is important.
<br />And to know that we created those things, those spaceships called LonelyShips, to make people happy.
<br />To make a good thing, the spaceships are lonely, but you're all here now, talking with each other, meeting new people and making friends.
<br />We are also commemorating here, commemorating... 2 years of the SpaceLiving Network, we are so happy to see all of your faces.
<br />And we are happy knowing that we made you people happy, and probably not lonely today, we are happy to give life to your thoughts.
<br />We are happy and proud to make your wishes a reality, and to provide the possibility of living how you want.
<br />We are so happy to write, to live and to create things for the people that want them, so, thank you all.
<br />Everyone who read the story too, Izaque, or stake2 or Funkysnipa Cat, you're a good guy, and a smart guy.
<br />Thanks for being in our LonelyShip and thanks for being yourself and thanks for existing, xD.
<br />Thanks for everything, and we will continue to live like this, and the SpaceShips will continue to exist.
<br />Also... protect yourself from the asteroids, dubstep is good, and be lonely! (well that's a weird thing to say after what happened today)".
<br />The screen disappears, a button to teleport back to your SpaceShip appears, Izaque, Wendy and Lisa keep talking there.
<br />Kendra, Drag, Ted, Monika, and John teleport back to their spaceships.
<br />"N√£o demora muito Stake" (Don't take too long Stake), says Manuh, who teleports back to her spaceship.
<br />After some time, Lisa teleports back to her spaceship, Izaque, and Wendy talks a little about the anniversary.
<br />"It was good right?", says Wendy.
<br />"Yea, it was pretty awesome, seeing everyone and stuff", says Izaque.
<br />They both teleport back to their spaceships.
<br />Izaque was a little tired, he watched an episode of the second season of One Punch Man and laid on his bed.
<br />He slept.
<br />Wendy was practicing on her keyboard, she thought she learned a lot since the last time she played.
<br />Manuh was sleeping already, Kendra was sleeping too, she was dreaming about No Man's Sky or a Synthwave world.
<br />Drag was listening to some kpop on his smartphone.
<br />Lisa was writing a little, The Odds Of Nature again ("She loves to write that story", says the *Writer*).
<br />Ted and Monika were watching a romance movie, they loved to watch it together.
<br />John was finishing the newest chapter of one of his stories [Me too, ah, stop breaking the fourth wall...].
<br />Everyone was happy in the SpaceLiving Network, living their lives, doing their stuff, doing what they love.
<br />It was a good day for SpaceLiving.

It was a beautiful day in the SpaceLiving world.
<br />Lisa, Izaque, Wendy, John, Ted, Monika, Manuh, Kendra, and Drag were all inside their spaceships, living happily.
<br />Izaque was looking for "New World Things" on the Internet and Discord Servers.
<br />He was a SpaceLiver or a resident of the LonelyShips but also liked to do "New World Stuff" in the earth.
<br />Izaque learned about this New World Theory in 2016, it was about a group of people that were changing the whole world.
<br />With holograms, soul-like body forms, beings, laws, he made the documentation of New World and a website for it in 2019, before being teleported to a LonelyShip.
<br />And sometimes, he teleports out of his spaceship, to do those New World stuff, to use holograms, to see his loved characters of his favorite cartoon.
<br />Which is My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, Izaque dreamed his entire life about being able to see them, to hug them, to talk to them.
<br />The first time he saw them, with the possibility that New World has created for him, was two months before he was teleported to his LonelyShip, he hugged every one of them.
<br />Twilight Sparkle, Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, Rarity, and Applejack.
<br />He was so happy at that moment, he could cry of happiness all day.
<br />New World and the New World Government have created a portal to all the visual things that humans have created, movies, cartoons, anime, games, series.
<br />Izaque loved to visit and talk with all his favorite characters, of MLP, Sword Art Online, Fairy Tail, To Love Ru, Shingeki No Kyojin, Yuru Camp, Plastic Memories, Eromanga Sensei.
<br />He had a lot of New World friends, who knew about New World its technology.
<br />Izaque was tired, he said for some Discord friends that he was going to take a nap, he looked at the computer clock and perceived that it was 12:00 in the afternoon.
<br />He said good afternoon to Wendy, Lulu, Igor, Carol, Paulo, Camila, and Natalia, then he turned off the computer and laid on his bed.
<br />Izaque was dreaming, he was a kid in that dream, a kid named Izaque, and he was eating dinner with Lulu, his sister, Ana, his mother, John, his father.
<br />He loved his family, Izaque loved to go out on adventures with Lulu and John, in one specific adventure, Izaque got a Gold Glove with jewels in it, he thinks the last user of this glove was sonahT.
<br />Izaque loved to use his glove, to protect his family, the glove had the power to create portals, to travel to another dimension, and to fire elements.
<br />One night, everyone except Izaque was sleeping, he grabbed his glove and got out of the house, then opened a portal to the My Little Pony World.
<br />It was his first time in another world, he transformed his glove into two normal, black gloves, and made himself invisible.
<br />He looked and analyzed the creatures of that world, they were ponies, then Izaque imagined himself like a pony, he transformed into one with a green mane, blue skin and became visible.
<br />A pink pony approached him, he was scared, because he didn't want to draw too much attention or make a commotion.
<br />The pink pony said in a sharp, shrill voice: "I've never seen you here in Ponyville, are you new?, 
<br />my name is Pinkie Pie and I am the receptionist, party planner, and cupcakes cooker of town, what's your name?."
<br />Izaque was scared and surprised about how that pony could talk so fast, it was hard for him to understand all those words in so little time.
<br />He replied: "Uh... my name is Izaque and yes, I'm new here, I don't want to live here, you know... I'm just a visitor, can I talk to...".
<br />At that moment, Izaque moved his right hoof to his back and used the hidden glove to know a little about the universe.
<br />It looked like he was stealing or copying the knowledge that the Izaque of Planet Earth in 2019 had about the My Little Pony universe.
<br />"Twilight Sparkle?", said him, finishing his sentence.
<br />Pinkie Pie said: "Oh, you wanna meet my friend Twilight right?, I'll take you to her".
<br />"Thanks a lot!", replied Izaque.
<br />They both walked to the Friendship Castle and Pinkie Pie knocked on the door.
<br />Twilight opened the door and said: "Oh hey Pinkie Pie", then turned her head to Izaque and said while getting close to his face:
<br />"Hey... I think I know you, you have an aura of someone I know... can I look at you more closely?".
<br />Izaque blushed and said: "W-well, maybe, hehe...".
<br />Pinkie Pie said: "Well... I'm gonna leave you guys alone", and started walking away from them.
<br />"Good!", said Twilight.
<br />Then she began to mumble while analyzing him, "You remind me of Izaque... a human that comes here sometimes", said her.
<br />"I fear you're a version of him from another universe, what are you doing here, and why are you a pony? how did you get here?".
<br />Izaque said: "Well... I just wanted to visit this world, I'm a pony because I have a magician item, I got here by that same magician item".
<br />Then he thought to himself: "Man, I have to go back, I learned through the Izaque of 2019 that one day in this world is one year at my world, I hope that's a myth".
<br />Twilight said: "Oh... and what magician item is that?".
<br />"Can I go in? I can't show that in public", whispered Izaque.
<br />Twilight said: "Sure!, come in", Izaque walked in and Twilight closed the door.
<br />"It's this thing here", said Izaque, while transforming his glove back to its original state.
<br />Twilight's eyes shined when she saw the beautiful, sheeny gold glove with jewels, she wanted to touch it.
<br />She moved her hoof close to the glove, Izaque moved the glove closer to him and said: "I gotta go Twilight, sorry, I'm gonna leave this... stone here, so you can remember that I'm gonna come back".
<br />"Oh, okay...", said Twilight, then Izaque created a small rock with the letter "I" on it and dropped it on the floor, opened a portal back to his world and crossed through it.
<br />He was back at his world, he came inside the house and walked to his room, stored his glove on a wooden chest and slept again.
<br />Before sleeping, Izaque thought: "I said I was going to travel to other worlds, Lulu of Planet Earth!".
<br />Then the dream of Izaque changed to something else, he was dreaming about a game called No Man's Sky.
<br />Wendy was in her spaceship, she perceived that she loved the bird Phoenix, and wanted to have one, she asked herself if she could create one in the spaceship.
<br />Then a voice started speaking in the spaceship, it said: "Do you want to have a pet in your spaceship?, then click on this button and the Pets menu will open on your computer".
<br />"If you had a pet in the earth, it would be brought together with you, but it seems that you don't have one, so get one at the menu".
<br />Wendy pressed the button and the menu opened in the SpaceLiving app that was installed in her computer, she then selected the Phoenix.
<br />The menu lets her choose only the name of the pet, she chose one and clicked on the "Spawn" button.
<br />A Phoenix appeared in her spaceship, the animal was a female, her name was "Philomena".
<br />The bird was an ugly bird, Wendy didn't like that, but then, the bird exploded in flames and became ashes.
<br />After some time, the ashes shine and a beautiful, yellow and red bird is born, shining more than the sun, Wendy got amazed by that.
<br />Philomena flew to Wendy's arm and she smiled, "I love you... Philomena...", said Wendy.
<br />Then after some time, an open birdcage and a nest appeared on the wall, it had bird food and water, a voice on the spaceship said:
<br />"The spaceship automatically detects if the pet needs food or water, if the pet drinks or eats all the food, the space ship will put more in there".
<br />"And the spaceship has a special place for each type of animal, so they can do their necessities, every time the pet thinks about doing that, the spaceship will release a scent".
<br />"A scent that makes the pet want to go to that special place, your pet will be in good hands, or more like... mechanical arms and pistons, thanks for getting a pet, take care of it!".
<br />Wendy was a little tired, she played some piano, Philomena danced to the music that she was playing, Wendy was happy about that.
<br />She got tired and laid on her bed, slept and had a good dream, a happy dream, where she was with her friends and had Philomena with her.
<br />Izaque was still dreaming about No Man's Sky, he was talking with a friend of him, a Korvax.
<br />John was writing one of his stories on his computer, he wanted to finish that chapter quickly because he was sleepy and tired.
<br />He finished the chapter and sent it to Lisa, she liked the chapter and told him to post it, he posted and received a lot of comments.
<br />John was too tired to reply to them all, he ate two chocolate crackers and drank a cup of water, then laid on his bed and slept.
<br />Every one at SpaceLiving was sleeping, it was 23:00 there, Ted was sleeping together with Monika.
<br />They always sleep hugged, Ted was dreaming about being the character of the survival game Don't Starve, the character was Wilson.
<br />He walked a little at the grassland, and gathered some grass and sticks, then made a campfire with rocks.
<br />After that, he took some trees down and put five logs into the campfire, cooked a pork-chop and ate it.
<br />Then he walked a little far to check some traps that he had made to catch some rabbits, three of them had rabbits trapped inside them.
<br />John picked up the traps and killed all the bunnies, then walked back to his campfire and cooked the three rabbits and stored them in his fridge.
<br />Monika was dreaming of being a computer file, she was inside a game, in that game, there were five characters, her, Sayori, Yuri, Natsuki, and Izaque, or the main character.
<br />She thought that the dream was really weird, it seemed too real, she knew that it was a game.
<br />A video was becoming famous at the Internet, it was a video that Izaque posted, he recorded his LonelyShip and made a tour through it.
<br />He showed his powerful computer, his ThoughtPoweredFridge(TPF), how it worked, how the buttons of the spaceship worked, what the windows showed.
<br />Izaque said it was a beautiful spaceship, with white walls, he said he loved to live there with Manuh, Drag, and Kendra.
<br />Lisa was listening to some synth-pop songs she had downloaded, she wanted to talk a little with Izaque.
<br />Izaque woke up, he needed some coffee, he got out of bed and opened the fridge, his beautiful, quadrangular, green cup was there, with some coffee with milk.
<br />It was hot, and the smell was amazing, the color, 20% milk, and 80% coffee, the milk was poured first, just like he liked.
<br />He surely loved that cup, it was his favorite cup at the earth, then he turned on his computer and played whatever he was listening to the last time he used the computer.
<br />It was a rock song, the volume was so high that he spilled coffee on the table and on the floor, "Shit!", shouted him.
<br />He paused the song quickly, left the cup on the table and picked up a napkin to wipe the table, then cleaned the table and changed his clothes.
<br />Izaque listened to a calm song while drinking his coffee and checking his social media, the name of the song was "Panda Eyes - Take My Hand Ft. Azuria Sky (Z‚àÜNE Remix)".
<br />Some people liked and commented on his stories in Wattpad, he replied to all of them, thanking his fans, then replied to his messages on Facebook and Discord.
<br />He loved to know that Wendy, Lulu, Paulo, and Igor had talked to him, he was so happy to see them every day, even if it wasn't physically.
<br />For him, was awesome to see their faces, or profile pictures every day.
<br />Kendra woke up and wanted to eat something sweet, she got up and grabbed a marshmallow that was inside the fridge.
<br />She ate it and loved it, then she wanted to listen to some rock on her computer, she put it to play.
<br />Kendra was just like Izaque, headbanging to rock just like he headbangs to Dubstep.
<br />Manuh and Drag were still sleeping, they were dreaming about a lot of things, Drag dreamed about visiting some k-pop artists.
<br />Then about playing a game in his smartphone, Free Fire, he liked to play that game.
<br />Manuh dreamed about living with Brendon Urie from the band Panic! at the Disco, she loved him.
<br />Wendy was dreaming about playing the piano, she thought about a good video that she saw one day, about a cover of Bad Guy from Billie Eilish.
<br />She liked that video, and sent it to a special friend of her, her friend like the video and thanked her.
<br />Monika was dreaming about living in the No Man's Sky world, those SpaceLivers(LonelyShippers) surely dream right? (informal: man they don't stop dreaming xDD)

<br />Lisa was sitting in her chair while looking at the computer screen, a notification got her attention.
<br />Someone asked to add her as a friend in Discord, it was someone called Littletato, she looked cute in the picture, Lisa accepted her friend request.
<br />They began to chat:
<br />Lisa: "Hello... do you added me from the SpaceLiving server right?".
<br />Littletato: "Yea... I've met some cool people there, and I thought you looked cool and gentle xD, I'm annoying you in some way?".
<br />Lisa: "Of course not!, I love to talk to new people ^^, you're a SpaceLiver right?, or a LonelyShipper".
<br />Littletato: "Yes, I guess I could be called that way xD, I was just scrolling Facebook at my computer and began floating and a light blue light surrounded my body, I didn't know what was happening, I was very scared...".
<br />Lisa: "Oh... that is one of the rumors that I been hearing, I think it was called Random-Teleport, it isn't the standard procedure for teleporting someone to a SpaceShip, I feel sorry for you...".
<br />Littletato: "Hm, thanks for explaining that to me, I already ate a slice of pizza an watched an anime called Eromanga Sensei, that is enough to be considered a SpaceLiver? xD".
<br />Lisa: "Maybe xD, actually, to be considered a SpaceLiver you have to be teleported to a SpaceLiving ship, there are a lot of cool things to do".
<br />Lisa: "Also... Eromanga Sensei?, I love that anime!, in fact, I look a little like the main character, Sagiri, here... I'll send a pic of me...".
<br /><br /><div class="mobileHide"><a href="https://thestake2.netlify.app/Images/Website Images/SpaceLiving/Chapter Images/Lisa.jpg"><img src="https://thestake2.netlify.app/Images/Website Images/SpaceLiving/Chapter Images/Lisa.jpg" width="35%" style="float:left;border-width:3px;border-color:black;border-style:solid;" /></a></div>

<br />Littletato: "Oh... you're cute xD, and you look like her! :3, I'll send a photo of me... don't look too much, I'm shy... :3".
<br />(Narrator-Izaque: Julia will get jealous Littletato... Don't send pics to her xD)

<br />Lisa: "Y-You're cute too! :3, hehe, I like your hair, I wanted to have that color, also... it is raining where your SpaceShip is located?, I've never seen a cloud near my spaceship before, this is weird...".
<br />Littletato: "Really? there are no clouds in here, how clouds can exist here if we are living in space xD".
<br />Lisa: "I don't know xD, hey, do you wanna meet some of my friends?".
<br />Littletato: "Um... sure, if they're as cool as you xD".
<br />Lisa: "Well, here's the discord tag of my friend Izaque, he is very cool, also, do you wanna read my stories?, Izaque writes too xD".
<br />Littletato: "I'm gonna add him, send me the link or file you would like me to read, I would love to read something made by you".
<br />Then Littletato asked for the friend request of Izaque and opened the story page of "The Odds of Nature", the story that Lisa had sent to her.
<br />Littletato began chatting with Izaque:
<br />Littletato: "Hello Izaque... Lisa sent me your discord tag so I added you on here, thanks for accepting the friend request, so... do you write stories? UwU".
<br />Izaque: "Well, I'm writing you right now... I-I mean, I'm writing something right now, but you can talk with me :3, I think Lisa didn't tell me that you were going to add me".
<br />Littletato: "Maybe you gotta talk with her about that, also, what you're writing?, I was watching Eromanga Sensei, I told that to Lisa and she told me that she looks like the main character, Sagiri".
<br />Littletato: "She sent me a pic of her... she's very cute, but you already know that right? you guys look to be very close friends...".
<br />Izaque: "Yea, well, actually, she never sent me a pic of her '-'... I'm gonna ask for her to send me a pic xD".
<br />Littletato: "That is weird xD... but probably she would send one to you, I-I...".
<br />Izaque: "What?, I'm not gonna judge you... don't need to worry".
<br />Littletato: "It's not that... I mean, I was teleported here by mistake, I was just minding my own business at my computer and I began floating and a light blue light surrounded me, then I was taken to this spaceship".
<br />Izaque: "So the rumors were true... the Random-Teleport, well, they said that you can go back, right? at least that's what the rumor says...".
<br />Littletato: "Yea, they said that I could right-click the tray icon and select [Teleport back to Earth], maybe it's a glitch or something, and the system called the wrong person?".
<br />Izaque: "Yea, I guess it's that, have you tried clicking that button? probably they will ask for a confirmation, don't worry".
<br />After that, Littletato right-clicked the tray icon and selected [Teleport back to Earth], a message prompted her confirmation saying "Do you really want to teleport back to Earth?".
<br />Littletato came back to the Discord window and sent a message to Izaque saying:
<br />"Yea... you're right, looks like it works, and it asked me for a confirmation...".
<br />Izaque: "Oh, that's cool, I hope you can get back on earth if you really want to, can I send you one of my stories?".
<br />Littletato: "Yes!, I would love to read something made by you ‚ù§Ô∏è...".
<br />Izaque: "Okay, I'll send it, I'll also add you to the Readers list :3".
<br />Then Izaque sent Littletato a link to his story, Clone Network.
<br />Littletato: "I'm so happy to be on that list! :3".
<br />Izaque: "Thanks for the love and support Littletato, I'm really happy I met you :3 ‚ù§Ô∏è".
<br />Littletato: "I think I'm gonna finish reading one chapter of The Odds Of Nature and Clone Network, thanks for sending me the link".
<br />Izaque: "Oh, the story of Lisa xD, she has a lot of talent for writing".
<br />Littletato: "I agree with you, makes me feel inside the story".
<br />Izaque: "I feel the same way xD, I think I'm gonna watch something from my To Watch list, Littletato, can I ask you something?".
<br />Littletato: "Yes?...".
<br />Izaque: "C-Can you send me a picture of you?...".
<br />Izaque: "Sorry, I shouldn't have asked that...".
<br />Littletato: "Okay, here it is, it's the same I sent to Lisa".

<br />Izaque: "Really?... you're really cute! :3... hehe, you have beautiful eyes...".
<br />Littletato: "Thanks Izaque! :3 ^w^, can you send me one of you too?, I am shy and embarrassed now...".
<br />Izaque: "Oh, sorry, I forgot!".
<br />(Well, guess I can't put that pic here xD, reader, I'm shy, sorry, please ask for my discord tag on my twitter profile if you really wanna see my face)
<br />Littletato: "You're so cuuuute! :3, I'm blushing so much right now, sorry".
<br />Izaque: "It's ok xD, thanks, you're also cute Pequenata, I mean, Littletato".
<br />Littletato: "How do you know that name?, some people call me Pequenata here in San Francisco, actually, *there* in San Francisco, I don't know why maybe it's the Brazilian version of the name...".
<br />Izaque: "I didn't know that, I mean, ah... I can't explain this... sorry".
<br />Littletato: "It's okay... I'm gonna read something, okay?, sorry if I don't reply too quickly :3".
<br />Izaque: "Okay :3, I'm a little busy here too xD".
<br />Littletato then began to read The Odds Of Nature, she read the story until the fifth chapter and stopped.
<br />After that, she read Clone Network and liked, she wanted to say that to Izaque and Lisa.
<br />Littletato opened her conversation with Izaque and said:
<br />"Hello... I loved your story Izaque!, I liked how you were making a lot of clones to make everything you want, that's a really good thought and an awesome idea xD".
<br />Izaque: "Oh, thanks for the feedback Littletato :3, I'm glad you loved it because I sure loved to write that story...".
<br />Izaque: "Also, can you promise me something Tato?".
<br />Littletato: "Tato, I liked that name xD, what is it?".
<br />Izaque: "Can you promise me that you will tell me when you begin to teleport back to earth?".
<br />Littletato: "Yes... I'll make sure to tell you, I promise :3".
<br />Izaque: "Thanks...".
<br />Littletato: "You're welcome my dear friend".
<br />Then Izaque opened his conversation with Lisa to ask something:
<br />"Hey, Lisa...".
<br />Lisa: "Hello Izaque!, how are you? :3".
<br />Izaque: "Well, I'm good, did you sent my discord tag to Littletato without asking me?".
<br />Lisa: "Uh... yea... sorry Izaque, I'm gonna ask for your permission the next time, sorry...".
<br />Izaque: "It's okay, I'm not mad at you :3, but... Littletato said you sent a pic to her, and you never sent a pic to me '-'...".
<br />Lisa: "Aww my sweetie... I didn't send it because you didn't ask... here, I'll send one to you, and... you never sent me one pic too xD".
<br />Izaque: "Sorry, I'll send xD".

<br />(again, can't show my face here xD)
<br />Izaque: "You're so cuuuuute Lisa! :3, I love your green eyes and your cute grey hair :3".
<br />Lisa: "You're so cute tooo my love! :3, I love your fluffy hair and cute face, your nose is cute too :3 xD".
<br />Izaque: "Thanks Lisa xD, I'm blushing right now, thanks for so much love ‚ù§Ô∏è".
<br />Lisa: "You're welcome my love! ‚ù§Ô∏è".
<br />...
<br />Littletato was worried about Julia, she opened the menu to teleport back to Earth when she was ready to click on the button labeled "Yes!", she thought about Izaque and Lisa, her two dear friends.
<br />She thought about telling them goodbye.
<br />(Play this song and read this part while listening to it: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/officialpandaeyes/oppositeside" class="w3-text-white">https://soundcloud.com/officialpandaeyes/oppositeside</a>)<br />
<br />Littletato opened the chat of Izaque and said.
<br />"Hello Izaque, I'm going back to earth now, it was good and fun to meet you, I was happy, maybe we'll see each other again soon... I hope you have a good day, or... night xD :3".
<br />Izaque: "It was fun to meet and talk with you too Littletato, I'll definitely write about you more, I mean, we'll definitely see each other again, maybe in chapter 50 of Pequenata, I mean, maybe soon! :3".
<br />Izaque: "Goodbye Littletato! :3".
<br />Littletato: "Goodbye Izaque! :3 :)".
<br />Then she talked to Lisa:
<br />"Hello Lisa, I'm going back to earth!, I hope we see each other again soon, I was happy while talking with you even if it was just for one day, thank you for that Lisa!".
<br />Lisa: "Oh, you're going now :), goodbye Littletato, I'm sure we'll see each other again, I was happy with you too! :3, thank you! :33".
<br />Littletato: "Tee hee! thanks, Lisa, goodbye :3".

Wendy was playing some keyboard on her spaceship, it was the theme song of the Titanic movie, she liked to practice keyboard.
<br />Izaque was thinking about his days at school, he had a lot of friends there and liked talking to them every day, the food was not very good but he liked.
<br />Monika was talking to some of her friends on Discord, one friend of hers was called Sayori.
<br />Monika said: "hey Sayori, how are you?..."
<br />Sayori: "hey Monika, I'm fine, how about you?"
<br />Monika: "I'm good too, just living here in the spaceship with my boyfriend Ted"
<br />Sayori: "Oh, I got a part-time job with Yuri, it is on a library"
<br />Monika: "That sounds very sweet Sayori, good luck on your job! What about Yuri?"
<br />Sayori: "Well... she liked the job because she loves books, so I guess its a really good job for her"
<br />Ted was playing some Titanfall 2 with his friends, after that he changed to Terraria.
<br />Izaque got a notification on the Discord server of SpaceLiving saying that a new SpaceLiver has arrived.
<br />The message says: "@Funkysnipa Cat#1778 Hello, a new SpaceLiver has arrived!, it would be good if you could greet them and explain to them about the SpaceLiving Network, thanks for your help! :)"
<br />Izaque then added the new SpaceLiver on Discord, she was called Marina.
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "Hello, I'm an admin at the SpaceLiving Discord server, they told me that you're new here, so... need help with anything? :)"
<br />Her user-name was Peach_Army, she said: "I wanted to know where I am, where all of this came from and who's the owner of this rabbit?"
<br />Funkysnipa Cat said: "Well... this spaceship is called "LonelyShip", she is hovering some kilometers away from earth, if you look through the window you will see the earth."
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "This bunny was given to you because you had thought before coming here about having a bunny, and then the spaceship gave it to you."
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "Don't worry, if you want to go back home you can click on the icon on your computer and click on "Teleport back to earth..."
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "The spaceship teleported you because it felt your desire, about living alone, only with a computer, food, a bathroom, this happened with me too, and with everyone at the server."
<br />Marina looked at the window and thought about the earth for a little, about everything she went through there, then she decides something and walks to the computer and types on the shiny keys.
<br />Peach_Army: "I want to stay."
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "Hm, I'm happy for you, I can assure you will be so much happy here, I hope I have helped you, we can be friends?... my name is Izaque."
<br />Peach_Army: "Well, if I'm gonna stay alone here with... the bunny, then yes, we can be friends."
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "Oh that's good, I'm glad, what's your name?"
<br />Peach_Army: "My name is Marina, nice to meet you."
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "Nice to meet you too Marina."
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "So... what do you like to do on the computer? :D"
<br />Marina: "I try to compose songs, play some games of strategy and talk a little"
<br />Marina: "I also see doramas"
<br />Marina: "and study"
<br />Marina: "How about you?"
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "Well, I watch anime, write some stories, talk with some friends here on Discord, help the new people who arrive, I love to play too, on Xbox One, PS4"
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "And studying was one of the boring things that I did in my life on earth xD, why do you study? or what you study?"
<br />Marina: "Actually, studying was one of the things I loved the most on Earth"
<br />Marina: "I like to know that what I learn will always innovate"
<br />Marina: "I must have been one of the only people who like math"
<br />Marina: "xD"
<br />Marina: "And I study Asian culture"
<br />Marina: "Mostly the Korean"
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "lol, I think I can drop the "first capital letter" and use period, they say I can't be friends with the people I help get to SpaceLiving"
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "I think I didn't like to learn what I wouldn't use like history, Brazilian Portuguese, or the things of the school, but I love to learn about technology"
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "I love Japanese culture"
<br />Marina: "One of my favorites too lol"
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "hahaha"
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "I love to show this New World to people, because I love to live in it, the SpaceLiving, but I don't like the rules, like the one I told you about"
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "do you know the name of the company that created the SpaceLiving Network?"
<br />Marina: "no.."
<br />Marina: "Which one?"
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "Its Think Outside The Box or TOTB"
<br />Marina: "How the families of the people of SpaceLiving feel like?"
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "I think they get sad, but some don't care, because they don't care about the relative, they receive a message like a hologram, telling that their relative of them is on a SpaceLiving"
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "you can eat what you want on the fridge, but your relatives can send special food for you if they want, just let them know"
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "like food from your grandma or mom that you love"
<br />Marina: "I see..."
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "there's also a teleporter on the spaceship that can teleport you to a house that you consider trustworthy like your parents' house to visit if you miss them"
<br />Marina: "I was going to ask that now xD"
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "xD"
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "just go there and think "my dad's house" "my mom's house" or something, and click a button called "Submit" "
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "the person who lives in the house of your choice will receive the notification and will choose to accept or not, then a teleporter will be created in the chosen house"
<br />Marina: "Got it..."
<br />Marina: "I think I'll like it here"
<br />Marina: "It seems my dream has finally come true, without the problems of others surrounding me"
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "That's very good Marina, this was my dream too, and living alone too, I love computers"
<br />Marina: "My computer gave life to me xD"
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "xD"
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "I think there's a boy who writes stories about this spaceship"
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "Or his spaceship in this case, maybe this boy is me xD, just maybe..."
<br />Marina: "Really?!"
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "yes Hahaha xD"
<br />Marina: "I'd love to read your story someday"
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "I'd love to send it to you"
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "there are already some chapters published"
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "want the link?"
<br />Marina: "Yes, Please"
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "<a href="https://diario.netlify.com/new_world/spaceliving/">https://diario.netlify.com/new_world/spaceliving/</a>"
<br />Marina: "Thank you"
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "you're welcome, thanks for reading"
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "I think in chapter 5 there's an invite to the SpaceLiving server, but that's kind of useless since you're already on it"
<br />Marina: "So, who reads till Chapter 5, and is on Earth, can go to SpaceLiving?!"
<br />Marina: "If I had known I would have read your story before xDDD"
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "xDD"
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "Well... no, I just send this story to someone that is already on a ship"
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "But I think there are some internet tutorials on how to be "invited" to live on a SpaceLiving"
<br />Marina: "I've never seen anything about it"
<br />Marina: "I would have liked it a lot"
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "Me too"
<br />Marina: "I'll talk to you later, I'm gonna watch an anime here, see ya later :3"
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "See you later Marina :3"
<br />Then Marina walked close to her TPF(Thought-Powered-Fridge) and thought about a coca-cola and a slice of pizza.
<br />She sat at her chair and laid the cup and plate on the top of the table, then downloaded an episode of the anime called Eromanga Sensei to watch.
<br />Marina ate the food and drank the soda while watching, she loved to watch anime while eating.
<br />After that, she was feeling a little tired, she said goodnight to Izaque and laid on her bed, then slept.

Izaque was in his LonelyShip, he was listening to a song of the Dubstep genre on Foobar2000, he thought about Marina, his special friend.
<br />He wanted to visit her somehow, or teleport to her LonelyShip, he messaged her on Discord, saying:
<br />"Hey Marina, can I teleport to your SpaceShip?... I wanted to visit you".
<br />She replied positively, then he opened the SpaceLiving Dashboard on his computer.
<br />A button popped up, it said:
<br />"Teleport to...".
<br />Then he clicked and typed the id of Marina's Discord alongside with her name.
<br />A message appeared on Marina's computer, saying:
<br />"Funkysnipa Cat#1778 wants to teleport to your LonelyShip, accept?".
<br />She clicked on yes, then the teleporter of Izaque began to shine blue, he walked inside it and closed the door.
<br />A blue light shines inside Marina's teleporter after it disappears Marina sees Izaque inside the teleporter.
<br />He gets out of it and says:
<br />"Hi Marina!", says Izaque.
<br />"Hi!", says Marina.
<br />"So... I guess it's been a while since I've seen a person... personally," says Izaque with a short laugh.
<br />"Yes," says Marina with a short laugh.
<br />"Can I sit on your bed?", asks Izaque.
<br />"Yes you can," she says, tapping the bed beside him, indicating that he should sit there.
<br />He sits on her bed and realizes that the coverlet of the bed is purple and is very beautiful, he starts looking at Marina's spaceship.
<br />She continues to fiddle with her laptop.
<br />He looks at Marina fidgeting with her laptop and has an idea.
<br />"Hey Marina, would you like to watch something with me? Like an anime? The spaceship has a computer too if you want, and a big screen," asks Izaque.
<br />"Okay... We can eat something while we watch," says Marina, who gets up and goes to the fridge, choosing some sweets.
<br />"Ok, thanks," says Izaque.
<br />"Can I go choosing the movie?" Asks Izaque.
<br />"Sure," answers Marina.
<br />"Okay," says Izaque.
<br />He grabs Marina's notebook, opens the SpaceLiving interface, activates the computer and large monitor, and uses the remote controller to pick a movie on the computer.
<br />It opens the SpaceFlix application on the computer, which has all sorts of things mankind has ever produced, anime, movies, series, doramas, videos.
<br />"What do you want to eat?" Asks Marina.
<br />"Hm... pizza, but without onion, and a coke," he says as he picks a specific Japanese dorama he knows Marina likes, called Meteor Garden.
<br />He selects the first episode and pauses waiting for Marina to get the food.
<br />She takes what he asks and for her, gets ice cream and some cookies.
<br />"I'm coming!" Says Marina.
<br />"Okay," he says smiling at Marina.
<br />She puts his pizza on a plate and takes it along with the Coke, "Here," she says smiling.
<br />"Thanks, Marina," he says, who then picks up his pizza and coke and settles into bed.
<br />She sits next to him and says:
<br />"What are you putting for us to watch?"
<br />"Meteor Garden, I think you like this drama, right?" He asks.
<br />"I love! Thank you!" she says, who smiles at him and looks at the screen.
<br />"You're welcome Marina," he smiles back at her, gets up, and picks up the computer's wireless mouse and keyboard.
<br />Izaque leaves the video in full screen and presses play, then sits back in bed to watch with Marina.
<br />Marina paid attention to every detail of the scenes while eating ice cream.
<br />He stared at the screen as he ate his piece of pizza and drank his coke.
<br />"Are you enjoying it?" She whispered now turning her attention to Izaque.
<br />"Yes, this drama is very cool, you have good taste Marina," he replies.
<br />"Thank you." She feels a slight flush on her cheeks and turns her attention to the screen.
<br />"You're welcome," Izaque smiles at Marina and turns her attention back to the screen.
<br />He thinks how cool it is to be able to live on a SpaceLiving spaceship and watch movies in high resolutions while eating delicious stuff, and he feels like it's been a long time since he had a physical connection with anyone.
<br />Izaque finishes his pizza and his coke, the episode is already halfway through.
<br />She eats some cookies, "Want?" She says offering him one.
<br />"Yes," he replies, taking a cookie and eating it.
<br />"It's nice to watch along with you Marina, I'm so happy," he says, smiling at her.
<br />"I enjoyed your company here Zaq!" She smiles back.
<br />"Thanks, I also enjoyed keeping you company," he replies.
<br />It was the end of the episode, Izaque's coke can was on his plate, and Marina's ice cream jar was on the floor.
<br />Izaque left Marina's computer screen on the desktop and stood up, taking his plate and her jar.
<br />"Thank you," she says.
<br />"You're welcome, hey Marina, I don't know if you know, but if you put your used cutlery, utensils and plates in the fridge, it'll get rid of them," he says, opening the fridge and placing the plate and jar inside as he explains.
<br />After that he opens the fridge and looks at Marina, she sees that the fridge is empty.
<br />"I didn't know, thanks for telling me," she says, who gives a short laugh.
<br />"So, I think I'll come back to my Marina spaceship, hey..." he says thoughtfully.
<br />"Go on," she says as she watches him closely.
<br />"Can I give you a hug before I go?" Asks Izaque.
<br />She smiles and gets up, approaching him and saying "Yes you can".
<br />Izaque hugs her and closes her eyes, enjoying the moment.
<br />"Thanks for keeping me company today, I wanted to see someone," she says as she hugs him tighter and then releases him, waving and saying, "See you."
<br />"You're welcome, see ya," says Izaque, who enters the teleporter, as he was a guest on Marina's spaceship, he can only teleport back to his spaceship.
<br />He closes the teleporter's door and pushes a blue button that says "Back to your spaceship." After a few seconds a blue light comes on inside the teleporter, he takes one last look at Marina and then disappears.
<br />Marina smiles at him before he disappears, and is pleased to see Izaque.
<br />Izaque goes back to his teleporter, opens the door and gets out of it, turns on his computer and opens Discord to talk to Marina.
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "Hey Marina... thanks for today, it was really cool, I think I'll get some sleep".
<br />Marina: "Yes, I really enjoyed today. Goodnight Izaque."
<br />Then Izaque turns off his computer, lies in his bed and sleeps.

Izaque was on his spaceship, he was on his computer, listening to a song called The Brig - Mind Changer.
<br />He was thinking about Marina, her friend that also lives in a spaceship, he wanted to see her again, even though they had seen each other last night.
<br />Izaque was thinking of calling Lisa to visit his spaceship for a few hours, he opened Discord and talk to her.
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "Hey Lisa, do you know about the new system of teleport between the SpaceShips?..."
<br />Lisa: "Yes, what's up?"
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "I think you already know that I visited the spaceship of Marina, right?"
<br />Lisa: "Yea, I know about that, what you're trying to say?"
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "I want to say is that I want you to visit my spaceship or me to visit yours..."
<br />Lisa: "Oh..."
<br />Lisa: "Well... I think so... I want to visit you..."
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "Oh... it'll be great... I think..."
<br />Lisa: "Yes... well, Izaque, I'm afraid of something..."
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "What?..."
<br />Lisa: "Marina already visited your spaceship, and... I'm afraid you're gonna do things that I don't want... did you do something... naughty with her?..."
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "Of course not... I only watched a movie with her and we ate some things, then she came back to her spaceship, I wouldn't do anything like that with you if you didn't want..."
<br />Lisa: "Hm... ok... can you call me now?... like... do the thing that teleports me there?..."
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "Hm... I'm sorry in advance, but I'm kinda busy now, can it be later?..."
<br />Izaque then looks at the clock of his computer, it says "00:20".
<br />Lisa: "Ah, that's okay, I'm kinda busy here too"
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "Okay, see you later my bb, love you <3"
<br />Lisa: "Love you Izaque <3, see ya later"
<br />Then Izaque continues using his computer, he watches an episode of Dr. Stone, he loves that anime.
<br />Izaque feels tired, he wants to sleep, Izaque watches an episode of My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic while eating a chocolate cake and drinking a coca-cola.
<br />Then he lies in his bed and closes his eyes, he sleeps, thinking about Marina and Lisa.
<br />Izaque dreams about being a human in Equestria, he is Izaque, a human that has golden wings made of lava fluid, a hand-grappling hook also made of lava fluid.
<br />He is also a half-human half-dragon, he breathes fire and haves lava instead of the normal human gastric acid.
<br />Izaque opens a purple portal and appears inside the Crystal Castle of Twilight Sparkle, she sees him and he sees her, Izaque talks with her:
<br />"Hey Twilight Sparkle!, how are you?" he asks.
<br />"I'm good, and you Izaque?" she replies.
<br />"Me too, long time no see right?" he says.
<br />
<br />Then Twilight replies: "Yea, but you're here now, and I'm happy because of that".
<br />
<br />Then Izaque told Twilight that he was talking with a friend of him, a friend from a distant place,
<br />Izaque was sat in the blue and comfy carpet that Twilight had, she stopped reading her book to listen to him.
<br />
<br />"Her name is Littletato... I'm her creator, you know... I wrote this story in 2016, it was called Littletato too,
<br />it was so awesome and is still so awesome to write that, I felt incredible and happy" explains Izaque.
<br />
<br />"Oh... that is very great to hear Izaque!, I'm glad you're having so much fun writing it,
<br />2016 was a long time on Earth right? like... 365 days, you're inspiring me to write a story Izaque!, that makes me soooo happy" replies Twilight.
<br />
<br />Then Izaque says: "Yea, a very long time, well... today right now in Earth is the year of 2019,
<br />I'm glad you're inspired by me Twilight, that makes me so much happy!, I would love to teach you how to write something!" says him.
<br />
<br />"I would love that!, please teach me, Izaque-sensei (teacher)" replies Twilight.
<br />
<br />Then Twilight asks: "Soo... how do you spoke with her? was it good?".
<br />
<br />"Yes, it was pretty good, well, I think she saw the Littletato story on Wattpad and asked for my Discord id, I gave it to her then she added me,
<br />thanked me for everything that I did, even if what I did was just create a story, I'm thankful for meeting her, my creation, haha, that was weird", explains Izaque.
<br />
<br />"Oh, that is a pretty good way of meeting someone, even though I don't know what Discord is, is it a network work that Discord created or something?
<br />how can you two connect that way?, sometimes I can't understand Discord, ugh..." says Twilight.
<br />
<br />"Well, Twilight, it isn't the Discord of this land, you know, Discord is only the name for a social network that exists on Earth,
<br />a technology network where people can talk with each other, I also can't understand him, never..." replies Izaque.
<br />
<br />Izaque says: "I also love Sword Art Online a lot, it was a anime on Earth that was launched in 2013, it is an anime, and it was my first anime".
<br />Twilight Sparkle replies: "Wow!, I would love to watch it with you, I bet it is really good, I also have things like that, that reminds me of my childhood, oh, the wonderful books that I've read when I was younger",
<br />"It makes me happy just to think, Izaque... never forget the things that make you feel happy... I love you Izaque".
<br />Twilight hugs Izaque, he says:
<br />"I love you too Twilight...".
<br />After some time hugging Izaque says:
<br />"Hey Twilight, I gotta go home, I will visit you again okay?, I love you" after saying that, Izaque kisses the cheek of the purple pony princess.
<br />"I love you too Izaque, see you" after saying that, Twilight kisses the cheek of the winged human-dragon hybrid back.
<br />Izaque creates another purple portal and goes back to Earth, he closes the portal and turns his computer on.
<br />He opens Wattpad and starts writing Littletato, a story that he loves to write a lot, then he thinks about writing SpaceLiving, another good story that he loves.
<br />Izaque thinks about Duda, Marina, Igor, Isabella, Ana, Carol, Fab, Wendy, MelodyStar, all of his friends, he loves them a lot.
<br />Then he finishes writing the chapter, he names it 28 - The beautiful Life of Littletato <3, he is so proud of writing that chapter because it makes him so happy.
<br />He thinks about his other story, SpaceLiving, he created it with a friend of him, Julia, it now haves 12 chapters, he loves writing it.
<br />The Izaque from the SpaceLiving universe which is the Izaque that is having this dream right now is feeling all of these things.
<br />He is feeling the emotions of the Earth-MLP Izaque, the New World Izaque, the Nazzevo Izaque, the Old World Earth Izaque.
<br />The SpaceLiving Izaque thinks all of that is weird, that dream.
<br />SpaceLiving Izaque feels and sees how it is to be in the skin of Earth Izaque, Earth Izaque is eating a pizza right now, while watching The Walking Dead.
<br />SpaceLiving Izaque wakes up and sits in his bed.
<br />He thinks and associates all of that information, he wonders who is the Earth Izaque, who is the New World Izaque, who is Isabella, Ana, Carol, Fab, MelodyStar.
<br />Izaque turns on his computer and opens Paint, the program that he uses to make pixel art and drawings even if he doesn't draw very often.
<br />He draws a pixel art of his SpaceShip, after some time he says and finishes it:
<br /><a href="https://diario.netlify.app/cdn/img/spaceship.png"><img src="https://diario.netlify.app/cdn/img/spaceship.png" class="mobileHide" width="66%" style="float:left;border-width:5px;border-color:black;border-style:solid;" /></a>
<br /><div class="mobileHide"><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
<br /><a href="https://diario.netlify.app/cdn/img/spaceship.png"><img src="https://diario.netlify.app/cdn/img/spaceship.png" class="mobileShow" width="100%" style="float:left;border-width:5px;border-color:black;border-style:solid;" /></a>
<br />Izaque becomes very proud of that drawing, he even shares it with some friends of him on Discord, Marina likes it a lot, Lisa too.
<br />Izaque thinks about that story that he dreamed of, Littletato, he knows that he never wrote it, he only wrote Kezzakam and SpaceLiving, also SpaceLivingXGDS.
<br />He searches for it in Wattpad, he finds out that a user, stake2, wrote Littletato, and Izaque uses that name(stake2) through the entire internet, he thinks that is weird.
<br />Izaque wants to sleep again, he is hungry too, he eats a slice of pizza and drinks coke, he turns off his computer and lies in bed again, trying to rest.
<br />He wants to dream more too, to know about things of other universes, the universe of Earth Izaque, of New World Izaque, of Old World Izaque.
<br />Izaque thinks that the fact that a lot of other Izaques exist is weird.
<br />A visual list with texts appears in his mind, he thinks it is a dream, the list says:
<br />"Earth Izaque, New World Izaque, Old World Izaque, SpaceLiving Izaque, Dreamworld Izaque, Nazzevo Izaque, Kingdom of Arstotzka Izaque, 'A Perfect World' Izaque,
<br />Omnipotent Izaque, Nothingness Izaque, Clone Network Izaque, Ilha Deserta Izaque, Relaxing Sunny Days Izaque, Ascencion To Equestria Izaque".
<br />A weird list with a lot of Izaques, a lot of versions of him, a lot of universes, multi-verse.
<br />Izaque(SL) thought that all of that information was a lot to digest, his head hurts, he thinks he haves to be an omnipotent being to understand that.
<br />He is still dreaming, a good and calm dream appears and he can have a good rest now.
<br />An audio message starts playing on the spaceship of Marina, saying: "Marina, come to me... I've sent this message to you by the universe feature that is called...
<br />"'Personal-brain spaceship connector' I guess, well... my name is Jay, I'm a Raptier, I live inside a planet called 'Osiris' in the same galaxy that you're on right now,
<br />The Milky Way, come with me, my id is Jay#3394, I've left a device in your spaceship for you to travel to my planet, there's a lot of nature here, I think it will be good for you,
<br />You can just visit and can go back to your spaceship whenever you want, don't worry, you won't be in any danger, we're a tribe that searches for humans to know us, 
<br />Because we're so mistreated and discriminated by humans, we need to be equal with humans, we don't wanna fight, please, visit us, thank you, Jay."
<br />Marina reads all of that, then lies on her bed, she sees the hand teleporter in the floor and thinks about going there at Osiris.
<br />She wonders if it will be good for her.
<br />Or if she will be in danger, she sleeps.

Everyone was inside their spaceships, and a message appeared on the computer of everyone, saying that they were close to the day 25 of December, which was Christmas.
<br />And everyone from the SpaceLiving Network was going to win a Christmas present.
<br />The ThinkOustideTheBox prepared a SpaceShip pack so they can use it and modify the color of the walls and furniture of their spaceships to a Christmas theme.
<br />They also prepared a movie, series and anime pack on the SpaceFlix app, which was used to watch things, it had a lot of Christmas stuff to watch there.
<br />The meal of the day was hot chocolate with chocolate chip cookies, and it was marked with a star in front of the door of the Thought Powered Fridge(TPF) so everyone could have it.
<br />There was also a spaceship that they could teleport to spend their Christmas with their friends and family and other SpaceLivers.
<br />A lot of SpaceLivers activated the Xmas theme and were watching Christmas movies in their spaceships.

<br />Lisa also wished happy holidays to John which was on Earth.
<br />Izaque started dreaming about Twilight Sparkle, he wondered how she was there, and if she was commemorating Heart's Warming in Equestria, with her friends.
<br />Twilight called him and said she was commemorating Heart's Warming with her friends, at the Crystal Castle of Friendship, she said she was having a good time there.
<br />Izaque thinks he was happy watching that anime with Lisa while he ate cookies and drank hot chocolate.

<br />Lisa was on her spaceship laid on her bed, listening to a song on her computer, it was called <a href="https://soundcloud.com/teminite/teminite-rattlesnake" class="w3-text-white">Teminite & Evilwave - [Uprising #07] Rattlesnake</a>.
<br />She loved that song, it was Dubstep but felt cool and energetic like rock and metal, she liked Teminite a lot, she even had him in her computer's music library.
<br />The gray-haired girl looked through the window and imagined how it was to live there, in Earth, she wanted to come back and she had her teleporter to do that, but she was afraid and unsure.
<br />"What would be out there?", "What I have to do?", "Will I be in danger there?", those were the kind of questions that popped in her mind.
<br />She got off the bed, paused the music and opened Discord.
<br />Funkysnipa Cat (stake2, Izaque) was online, she wanted to talk with him and clicked on his chat, then began typing.
<br />Lisa: "Hey Izaque... do you ever thought about coming back to Earth?".
<br />Izaque: "Yes... actually a lot of times... but... I came back to Earth a lot of times, so I'm used to it, SpaceLiving is connected with the New World, so I have things of the New World to do".
<br />Lisa: "Oh, that's good I guess... sounds like you have a lot of fun outside of the spaceship right?".
<br />Izaque: "Yea, a lot, but I have fun here too, talking to SpaceLivers/LonelyShippers, I love to be inside this spaceship right now, hm... why are you asking me that, Lisa?".
<br />Lisa: "It's that I want to go back to Earth... but I'm scared that I'm not gonna fit in... like... I don't know how to talk to people personally, and I'm not sure if my old house will accept my teleport request...".
<br />Izaque: "Oh... well... hm... we never met personally... right?... I mean... both of us inside the same spaceship...".
<br />Lisa: "Yea... I would like to meet you personally...".
<br />Izaque: "Me too... but... you said you were afraid of... coming here in my spaceship... like... you said 'I'm afraid you're gonna do things that I don't want'...".
<br />Lisa: "Hm... yes... I'm a little afraid of that... sorry... it's nothing about you and I'm not afraid of you... don't worry... I love you, Izaque <3".
<br />Izaque: "Oh... I know, I love you too, Lisa <3, and I'm happy that you're not afraid of me... do you want to make a deal?".
<br />Lisa: "What deal?".
<br />Izaque: "Hm... I promise not to do anything that you don't want? okay?... and... you can tell me when you feel uncomfortable with me okay?...".
<br />Lisa: "Okay Izaque, thanks for that... I mean... asking that... It's a promise, right? :3".
<br />Izaque: "Yes, I promise, Lisa :3".
<br />Lisa: "Thanks Izaque ^^".
<br />Izaque: "No problem Lisa ^^".
<br />Then Lisa got up, walked to the front of the Teleporter, opened the door and came inside, she closed the door and selected the Discord ID of Izaque, which was Funkysnipa Cat#XXXX (Censored).
<br />A blue light appeared inside the Teleporter and Lisa disappeared from her spaceship, reappearing on the Teleporter of Izaque.
<br />Izaque looked behind and Lisa was there, she walked outside of the Teleporter and was barefooted with a gray coat, she was so beautiful, the ambient lights of the spaceship shone on her.
<br />He could see her beautiful streams of gray hair, Izaque thought she was amazing and gorgeous, it was incredible to see her in person.
<br />"Hey, Izaque... why are you making that face? It looks like you saw a ghost haha" asks Lisa while laughing a little.
<br />"It's that I... hm... I think you're pretty cute Lisa... and beautiful too... I love you hair... s-sorry to say this..." replied Izaque.
<br />"Hm... no need to apologize... you already said that in Discord... but personally is different... thanks for the compliments Izaque!... I'm happy that you think I'm beautiful... t-thanks..." said Lisa while blushing.
<br />"No problem... hm... I'm a little... shy now... you know," said Izaque.
<br />"Y-Yea... me too... sorry..." replied Lisa.
<br />"No need to say sorry..." said Izaque.
<br />"Can I sit on your bed?" asked Lisa.
<br />"Of course!, feel at home Lisa" replied Izaque.
<br />"Thanks..." said Lisa, who had sat on the bed.
<br />"So... do you want to eat something?... or... watch a movie..." asked Izaque.
<br />"Hm... actually, Izaque... I want you to teach me how to talk with people... come here and sit with me... on the bed..." said Lisa.
<br />Izaque then got up and sat by the side of Lisa, he looked at her beautiful green eyes and she looked at his eyes too.
<br />"So... hm... how do you talk to people?" asked Lisa.
<br />"You simply talk with them, try to talk with some people to get used to it... talk to me, Wendy, Ted, Monika, John, Marina, I'm sure they will be happy to talk with you, you're a pretty cool girl to talk with," said Izaque.
<br />"Oh, thanks Izaque, thank you so much, I'll try to talk with them... personally I mean, I'll try to ask them if I can teleport to their spaceships" replied Lisa.
<br />"Okay, try that, I think that will help," said Izaque.
<br />Then Lisa blushed a little and laid on the bed.
<br />"Do you want to eat or watch something?" asked Izaque.
<br />"Maybe... hm... y-yes... I want... hm... hey Izaque..." said Lisa.
<br />"Yes?" asked Izaque.
<br />"I want you to... I mean... do you like me?... as a friend..." asked Lisa.
<br />"Yes, I like you as a friend..." replied Izaque.
<br />"Oh... hm... me too, do you like my body?..." said Lisa who was blushing like a tomato.
<br />"Y-Yes... I like your hair, it is cute... your face is beautiful... I like... your legs... hm... sorry..." said Izaque while blushing.
<br />"It's okay... I like your hair too... your lips... your face is pretty cute... I like your hands..." said Lisa as she blushed a little.
<br />"T-Thanks Lisa... hm... I'm really happy that you think that... I'm happy you're here with me... I like your companionship..." said Izaque.
<br />"Thank you Izaque, I'm happy here with you too, and no problem, do you want to do something with me?... I-I mean... not in that way, of course, O////O," asked Lisa.
<br />"Yes... n-not in that way too... I want to watch a movie with you... hm... can I turn on my computer?" asked Izaque.
<br />"Of course, the computer is yours," replied Lisa.
<br />Then Izaque got up and clicked on the blue button on his computer case and the login screen appeared, he typed his password and opened the Netflix app.
<br />He looked to Lisa which was behind him and asked if she wanted to watch Eromanga Sensei.
<br />She replied that it was her favorite anime and she liked to draw just like Sagiri.
<br />Izaque was happy because of that, he opened the anime on Netflix, the first episode, and paused it.
<br />"You would like something to eat?, you can pick up in the fridge there," said Izaque.
<br />"Okay, thanks Izaque," said Lisa.
<br />Then Lisa got up and grabbed a plate with some pieces of chocolate cake and a can of coke, she sat at the right side of the double bed and looked at the computer screen.
<br />Izaque activated the large 50-inch television that emerged from the inside of the wall and opened the fridge to grab a sack of Doritos and two cans of coke.
<br />He grabbed a TV controller and sat on the left side of the bed with his food, he laid his sack of Doritos on the bed and played the first episode.
<br />Izaque opened his first can of coke and drank it a little, Lisa also opened hers and drank it a little, then she started eating some pieces of her chocolate cake.
<br />They both watched the episode, Izaque and Lisa loved that anime, they liked to see Sagiri drawing, her brother as a writer.
<br />Lisa felt that she was like Sagiri, drawing and being alone in her room, listening to music and watching anime.
<br />Izaque felt that he was like Masamune, writing fiction and stories, trying to sell them, but he also felt like he was like Sagiri, liking being alone shut in her room.
<br />"I feel like you're my older brother Izaque... I feel like I'm Sagiri and you're Masamune... hm... is it weird if I feel that way?..." asked Lisa.
<br />"Of course not... it is normal, I feel like that too... I feel like you're my younger sister, like Sagiri, you're as cute as her, and have gray hair too..." said Izaque.
<br />"O-Oh... thanks Izaque... you're cute too... my older brother... h-hey Izaque..." said Lisa.
<br />"Yes?..." said Izaque.
<br />"Do you want to lay on my lap?" asked Lisa.
<br />"Yes... I-I would like to do that... you will caress me?" asked Izaque while blushing a lot.
<br />"Of course..." said Lisa.
<br />Then Izaque laid his food and cans of coke on the floor and laid his head on the lap of Lisa.
<br />Lisa began to caress the head of Izaque.
<br />"Thanks, Lisa," said Izaque.
<br />"No problem..." said Lisa.
<br />"Hey... Izaque..." said Lisa.
<br />"Yes?," asked Izaque.
<br />"I think I'm comfortable to be with you right now... I mean... being here with you on your spaceship, I feel good, I feel great... and I'm happy here with you... thanks for letting me come here..." said Lisa.
<br />"Oh... I'm happy that you're comfortable here with me Lisa... I'm pretty comfortable here with you too, so... thanks... I feel good, great and happy too, thank you for making me company today," said Izaque.
<br />"No problem my dear..." said Lisa.
<br />"Hehe, my love," said Izaque.
<br />"My dear, my love... hehe," said Lisa.
<br />"C-Can I kiss your cheek?... h-hm... s-s-sowwy Lisa... I t-think what I said was a little weird..." said Izaque while stuttering and trembling a little. 
<br />"Y-You can... feel free to kiss my cheek Izaque, don't worry, it wasn't weird to say that, you're a pretty great friend..." said Lisa.
<br />"Okay," said Izaque, then he gave a small and quick kiss on the cheek of Lisa.
<br />She blushed a lot and giggled a little, feeling happy and shy.
<br />"T-Thanks Izaque... I liked the kiss... OwO," said Lisa.
<br />(Author: Aaaaaaaaaaaaa- what am I doing with my character)
<br />"No problem Lisa..." replied Izaque.
<br />Then they were in the half of episode two, Lisa was a little tired and wanted to sleep.
<br />"Hey Izaque, I'm a little tired, sorry," says Lisa while letting out a long yawn.
<br />"It's okay, do you want to go now? I had fun, don't worry, I loved having your company today," says Izaque.
<br />"Oh, I'm happy that you like my presence and enjoys being with me Izaque, thanks, I think I'll go to my spaceship," says Lisa while smiling.
<br />"Okay, I'll pause the anime, do you want to come here again?, to watch something, or play a little, maybe I can activate the double computer module from the SpaceShip," says Izaque while smiling happily.
<br />"Yes, I would like to come here again to spend time with you, I would like to play or watch something again," replies Lisa, smiling while looking at Izaque.
<br />"Okay, then, send me a message on Discord when you want to come here again okay?" asks Izaque, looking at the eyes of Lisa and feeling happy.
<br />"I will, thanks Izaque," says Lisa.
<br />She gets up and throws her can of coke on the trash bin of the TPF Fridge and also the plate where she ate the chocolate cake.
<br />Lisa walks to the Teleporter and looks at Izaque, she is trying to say something but begins to stutter and blush.
<br />Then she builds up courage and says:
<br />"Hey, Izaque... I would like a hug before I go, c-can you please g-give me one?" says Lisa, while trying to look at the eyes of Izaque, her heart beating faster and her becoming shyer and blushing more, she is unsure if that is what she wants, and she gets a little uncomfortable.
<br />Then Izaque says "Yes, of course, I can..." and walks closer to Lisa, she gets more and more embarrassed as he comes closer to her, he hugs her tight and she hugs him back in return, he starts caressing her soft gray hair, Lisa feels happy and fulfilled, feeling the embrace of Izaque and hearing his breath, Lisa is right where she wants to be now, she is now sure that this is what she wanted.
<br />Izaque is happy in that moment, he didn't know he would be able to hug her, his dearest friend, he liked her a lot, and feeling so close to her made him feel secure, joyful and glad, hearing her breath and feeling her embrace, he wanted that moment to last forever, Izaque wished that he could live forever so he could experience a lot more than that.
<br />After hugging for a while, Lisa and Izaque broke from the hug and Lisa smiled, Izaque smiled back.
<br />"Thanks, Izaque, I had fun today..." says Lisa while smiling from ear to ear and looking at Izaque, her eyes shining.
<br />"No problem Lisa, I had fun today too... thanks for spending so much time with me, it felt great, I love you, my friend," replies Izaque, beaming with joy.
<br />"I love you too, my dearest friend," says Lisa while some tears come up in her eyes, then she enters the teleporter and clicks on a button named 'Teleport To My SpaceShip (Lisa)', waving goodbye while smiling at Izaque, and Izaque waving goodbye back, as the light of the Teleporter begins to shine, she disappears, back to her spaceship, Izaque looks at the Teleporter, then to the white floor.
<br />And starts thinking about his day and tries to consolidate everything he lived through the day, he was just having a boring day at his SpaceShip, then Lisa began talking to him, asking him if she could come over to his spaceship.
<br />He was so happy receiving that message, he sats on the bed and thinks about Lisa, smiling from ear to ear without realizing, recalling the feeling of her hug, her embrace, and her voice, the feeling of watching something with her, it was great.
<br />The two cans of coke and the Doritos sack is still there on the floor, he grabs the cans and put them in the trash bin of the TPF Fridge, then does the same to the Doritos sack, the Fridge deletes everything that is inside the trash bin.
<br />Izaque lays on his bed and thinks about Lisa for a while, daydreaming a little.
<br />Then, he stands up and sits on his chair, deactivating the 50-inch screen and closing the Netflix app, he opens up Discord and sends a message to Lisa, who is offline at the time being.
<br />His username on Discord is 'Funkysnipa Cat'.
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "Hey Lisa, thanks for spending time with me, I liked to watch your favorite anime with you, I think I'm really like Masamune xD, thank you for drinking coke with me, and... h-hm... for the other things we did... you know... me laying in your lap...".
<br />Funkysnipa Cat: "You caressing my hair... and hugging me... I was really happy... t-to be with you today, thanks, Lisa, I love you so much, my friend <3".
<br />He sent the message, grabbed a bottle of cold water from the Fridge and put a song to play on Foobar2000, his music-player on the computer.
<br />The song he was playing was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOxkGD8qRB4" class="w3-text-white">K/DA - POP/STARS (ft. Madison Beer, (G)I-DLE, Jaira Burns) | Music Video - League of Legends</a>.
<br />He liked that song a lot and was addicted to it, Izaque began drinking some sips of his cold water bottle, feeling refreshed, then he noticed that Lisa was online on Discord, she began typing, replying to him.
<br />After a while, she sent a message, it was:
<br />Lisa: "hey, Izaque, thanks for spending time with me too, I was really happy and glad I could meet you in person, and I was happy to watch Eromanga Sensei, Sagiri is like me xD, the coke was great, and...".
<br />Lisa: "hm... yeah... that part of the visit was great too... your hair was so soft to caress, and your embrace was so good to feel... thanks for hugging me... and saying that I'm beautiful... I'm really happy and thankful for that, Izaque, it made me so happy, thanks for having me, I love you so much, my friend <3 :3".
<br />Then Izaque reads the message while drinking water, smiling happily, after some sips, he leaves the bottle on the table and begins typing, replying to Lisa and thanking her.
<br />Izaque then says goodnight to his friends at Discord and leaves his computer on, with a Custom Status saying: ":spaceliving: Sleeping at the SpaceLiving SpaceShip Zzz...".
<br />He lays in his bed and the SpaceShip lights turn off, leaving only the light of the stars, the moon, sun and Earth to light the spaceship, he covers himself and sleeping, relaxing and having good dreams.
<br />
<br />...

<br />At Lisa's spaceship...
<br />Lisa is eating some Doritos while listening to a podcast about nutrition, looking at her screen and drinking coke sometimes, she thinks a little about Izaque and her trip to his SpaceShip, she had fun there and was happy, Lisa wants to go there again.
<br />After a while, she finishes emptying the sack of Doritos and the can of coke.
<br />She places the sack and can on the trash bin of the Fridge and it deletes both of them.
<br />Then Lisa pauses the podcast, saves the part where she stopped and closes the podcast app.
<br />The gray-haired girl says goodnight to her friends on Discord, and also to Wendy and John.
<br />She wonders if Ted and Monika are having fun there, Lisa only saw them on the SpaceLiving2YearAnniversaryMeeting‚Ñ¢ but never talked to them.
<br />Lisa decides that she will talk to them tomorrow on Discord, she leaves her computer on and adds a Custom Status to Discord saying: ":spaceliving: Sleeping at the SpaceLiving Ship :3".
<br />She lays in her bed and the lights of the SpaceShip turn off, Lisa is having a good dream.
<br />Good Night Izaque, Good Night Lisa, the day of tomorrow will be good for both of you, this is the narrator of SpaceLiving‚Ñ¢, I love breaking the fourth wall of writing, thanks for reading, I'm writing this on 17/02/2020 while listening to K/DA - POP/STARS remixes, thanks for coming to my story, leave a Comment on Comment: <i class="fas fa-comments"></i>, or Write SpaceLiving for me so I'll maybe put your chapter here by clicking on Write: <i class="fas fa-pen"></i>.
