"They started to knew each other a little more, That other potato was called Julia and was of pink color, <br />
they planned a whole life... they planned what city they would go, what house and a lot of other things, <br />
and they traveled to that city that they dreamed of, the city was San Francisco, they bought a house and lived there, <br />
once in a while Littletato came out to the shop to buy things, <br />
but she didn't bought tatos(potatoes) because that was cannibalism and she thought that this thing that humans made is bad, <br />
to put living things there, San Francisco was a city where vegetables and fruits could live safe without humans close, <br />
but still vegetables and fruits were sold, other people bought fruits and vegetables to eat, but Littletato thought that that was gross, <br />
she only bought meat and milk, and some grains like rice and beans, then Littletato found a friend of her while walking home, <br />
the friend was a sweet potato called Yam, Yam was of masculine sex, Yam and Littletato talked a lot, <br />
Yam said that in Las Vegas they sold meat and vegetables even if there was Cows in there and they continued to talk, <br />
then Littletato finished the conversation and started walking to home again..."<br /><br />

"Then Littletato came back to her home, and talked to Julia about the conversation she had with Yam, <br />
then she placed the food she bought from shop in the table, she helped Julia prepare the dinner, <br />
they made the dinner and ate it, then slept, in the other day Littletato woke up but Julia didn't wake up, <br />
Littletato got out of bed and started to make breakfast and drank milk with chocolate and ate some breads with butter, <br />
then she came to the room where her and Julia slept, she thought that Julia was so cute sleeping that she didn't woke up her, <br />
Littletato had a computer in her house, it was in the living room and was where she had all the information about the world, <br />
she then came to the computer and turned it on, she logged in her Vegebook account and she saw all her friends, <br />
even if this friends were just on the internet, she thought that was awesome to have friends, then she became to roll on the page, <br />
her friends always posted some news, and one news interested her, it was a news about how New York citizens were trying to fight the fruits and wanting freedom, <br />
the news said that fruits was invading New York and the vegetables didn't liked that, Littletato thought that San Francisco was good because of that, <br />
the city of San Francisco was stabilized, no fight between the citizens, and then Littletato closed the page and came back to rolling her Vegebook timeline, <br />
then Yam, her old friend called her on the chat, he said that in New York they had good jobs, <br />
but then Littletato answered that she already had a home in San Francisco and didn't need to work, then Yam asked how, <br />
then she replied that she had a girlfriend in San Francisco, and then Yam said that he forgot that and said that he had to do somethings, <br />
Littletato replied the same, they finished the conversation and Littletato signed out of her Vegebook account, <br />
and came out of the house to relax a little, then came back again and closed the door, <br />
Julia called her and Littletato came to her room to see what Julia was needing, Julia said that was nothing with a smile of her face, <br />
then said that she loved Littletato, Littletato said the same, then Littletato came back to bed to sleep a bit more, <br />
she looked on clock and was six am, then Littletato hugged Julia by her back and they slept together..."<br /><br />

"Then the clock ringed, Littletato woke up and saw the hours, it was eleven in the morning, <br />
she got out of bed to make coffee, and made coffee, she poured coffee in her squared mug, <br />
and poured in other mug at the other side of the table to Julia, and she placed butter in her bread and in Julia's, <br />
then she came to her bed to wake up Julia, Littletato gave a kiss in the cheek of Julia and said wake up to her, <br />
Julia slowly opened her eyes and looked at Littletato with a smile on her face, then Julia hugged Littletato, <br />
Littetato smiled and called Julia to eat breakfast, they came to the kitchen and ate while talking about somethings, <br />
then Julia said that she was going to call her sister to visit her house, and Littletato said she wish to met Julia's sister, <br />
then Julia smiled, Littletato said that she was going to work, Julia smiled and said ok, Littletato carried up the things she needed for the job, <br />
and said goodbye to Julia then got out the house and started walking to her job, then she arrived at work, and then started to work, <br />

then they closed and started to play some Vegewatch, Littletato liked to play as V.va, Julia liked to play as Vercy, <br />
Littletato thought: "What if I could play all these games inside a spaceship on the space?", <br />
Littletato then thought that was just a random thought, then after some time Littletato and Julia wined the match, <br />
they closed the game, Julia said she had fun, Littletato said the same, Littletato and Julia liked to read some stories on the internet too, <br />

It was a Wednesday, Littletato was sat in her computer, listening to some Dubstep in the Vegecloud website, <br />
she liked and followed some Dubstep artists, she was listening to the "Fucking Noise" song of the artist "Stratus", <br />
she liked that song, Littletato was doing that while she talked with her friends on Vegecord, an app that <br />
she had on her computer, the app was made for gamers that wanted to share what they were gaming, <br />
she was in a Vegecord server of the site SuperAnimes, that was the site where she watched anime, <br />
she wanted to know about the news of the site, Littletato liked to write stories too, <br />
she loved to write one specific story of hers, called "Kezzakam", she posted that story in the Veggepad, <br />
Yam and Carol liked Kezzakam, they loved to receive a notification of Littletato on Vegebook saying that a new chapter was published, <br />
after sometime she closed Vegecloud, she downloaded some songs, Littletato also liked to draw, she wasn't very good, <br />
but she had fun, she posted her drawings at Vegiantart, she received a lot of favorites and comments, Littletato also used Vegewitter, <br />
she liked to post there but there wasn't much people to read her Vegeweets, but she liked to read other people's Vegeweets, <br />
then she turned her computer off and got up to make another thing.<br />
<br />
Author's note(Isaac notes): Today was the first day writing Littletato without listening to Indie Folk songs, that was cool, <br />
I wrote while listening to some Dubstep on Vegecloud, was good.<br />

there were black chocolate, white, some different ones like a black diamond one, KitKat too, <br />
milk chocolate, it was an interesting city, they liked to be in there, <br />
they stopped by a shop to talk with some people, there was a white chocolate person named Layla, <br />
she asked if Littletato was not from there, Littletato replied positively, <br />
Layla said that there are some few people that are vegetables there, <br />
but the city is mainly composed of chocolates, then Layla said for them to look around the city, <br />
if they think is good, they can move to Texas, Littletato met a lot of new people there, <br />
she liked the city, then Julia and Littletato stopped by a park to eat a little, <br />

they were so happy in that moment, seeing the city, a emotional song was playing, "Energy" by "IFeature", <br />
the song provided the exact feeling they were feeling at that moment, <br />
Julia placed her hand on top of the hand of Littletato, Julia was thinking about My Little Pony, <br />
how she loved that world, how that world made her happy, and how much she was happy at that moment, <br />
just like the happiness that My Little Pony brought to her, she was inspired, she was happy, <br />
