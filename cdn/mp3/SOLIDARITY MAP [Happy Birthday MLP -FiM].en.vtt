Looking back feels so bittersweet

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.580
I'd never imagine what we started 
could mean so much to me

It might be true we've passed the golden years

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.520
Well let them say what they want I'll politely disagree

Each one of you taught me something about friendship,
