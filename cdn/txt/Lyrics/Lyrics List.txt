H8_Seed Neverending Strife

Oh please, excuse me, I don't mean to alarm
And certainly, I mean you no physical harm
I'm just the reigning king of chaos here to rock your world
So just sit tight and let this little story unfurl

My mission is simple: Neverending Strife
I'll worm into your heart and then I'll cut like a knife
My intentions are clear, so just surrender your will
I'm a predator, and I'm going in for the kill

Don't hate me cause I'm funny
Don't hate me cause I'm beautiful
You should hate me cause I'm better than you

I only want to party
I only want to play it cool
I'm beholden to seeing this through

I could trot around your little pony head
Spreading white lies and whispers
I'm gonna tell you about your fickle pony friends
Your rage is so hot, it blisters

I have your attention now, it's futile to flee
Your Elements of Harmony are worthless to me
So please--you can't beat me, just fire away
I'll shrug it off and live to laugh another day

My hatred and wisdom are a thousand years old
Millennia trapped in stone and desolate cold
Your princess couldn't save you. You have no hope
You're hanging yourself, I'm just providing the rope

We Are Number One

Hey!
We are Number One
Hey!
We are Number One
Now listen closely
Here's a little lesson in trickery
This is going down in history
If you wanna be a Villain Number One
You have to chase a superhero on the run
Just follow my moves, and sneak around
Be careful not to make a sound
Shh
C R U N C H
No, don't touch that!
We are Number One
Hey!
We are Number One
Ha ha ha
Now look at this net, that I just found
When I say go, be ready to throw
Go!
Throw it at him, not me!
Ugh, let's try something else
Now watch and learn, here's the deal
He'll slip and slide on this banana peel
Ha ha ha, WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?
ba-ba-biddly-ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
We are Number One
Hey!
ba-ba-biddly-ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
We are Number One
ba-ba-biddly-ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
We are Number One
Hey!
ba-ba-biddly-ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
We are Number One
Hey!
Hey!

Friendship

So, the song is about friendship. Obviously. This song isn't about anypony specific, but it's sort of a future situation between the good friends that the Mane 6 are. It's a sad song, but happy at the same time. The message is this: life has its problems, but friendships are worth saving. :3

I believed what we had would last forever
After all the moments we spent together
Were they meaningless in the end?
If friendship is supposed to be magic
Why has ours become so tragic
I'm no longer proud to call you my friend

Feels like after all this time
You should have known we'd be here tonight
Wondering where the past has gone
All the memories we lost when we moved on
Honestly
It hurts thinking
About the way
We were, just you and me
This isn't what friendship is supposed to be

Giving up always seemed so easy
But it's hard when it's you and me
And I don't want to say goodbye
We've hurt each other time and time again
I guess all good things come to an end
But I don't want to lose you tonight

Don't say goodbye
I promise everything will be alright
Don't leave me
I'm sorry
I'll fix this if it costs me my life
I'm going to make this right

Open Your Eyes 

A while back, I had mentioned on my Twitter that I was really inspired and wanted to make a song about the season 3 finale. Well, here it is! This is a song from the perspective of Twilight trying to show her friends who they're supposed to be, breaking the spell.

I watched them change before my eyes
Destinies rearranged to my surprise
I tried so hard to make amends
But my mistake has separated my friends
White turned to blue, and blue to white
Harmony rewritten out of sight
What can I do to bring you back
My technicolor world has faded to black

Wake up now and see the truth
I'm here to show the world to you
The way it was meant to be
So follow your destiny
This twisted future isn't right
Let's bring the real you to the light
I'm going to make you realize
So open your eyes

I've made mistakes and failed before
But somehow this time it's something more
Broken your life and who you are
I'm afraid I've left a terrible scar
But apologies won't save me now
It's up to me to restore you somehow
I'll bring you back your memories
piece by piece restoring harmony


I've got to find a way
To make this all okay
I've got to find a way
To fix my own mistake
Oh, but I promise to succeed
But I know you're still in need
I know you have been misused
And you're probably confused
But there's not much I can do
The cure is within you
So hold on tight
And open your eyes

----------------------------

The Real Me 

I've always been a little shy
But somehow there came a time
I lost what I lived for
I became a monster
I'm not that pony anymore
I guess I got some bad advice
I haven't been very nice
But I'm leaving that now
I won't ever let you down
I'm back to the way I was before

I'm gonna stand up for what's right
I won't let what I say get between you and I
Because being mean isn't what I want to be
Back to hiding behind the crowds
Back to hiding the words I shouldn't say out loud
Because this is the real me

I tried to stand up for myself
But that didn't quite work out
Guess I really messed up, now I'm trying to 'fess up
I promise to never turn into a bully like that again
From now on I will assert
Without letting you get hurt
Learned from that, won't go back
Forever I'll be your faithful friend

I will always be
Nothing more than me
It's who am to be shy
So I guess that's alright
I won't try to change again
I refuse to hurt my friends
From now on what you'll see
Is the real me

Aviators and Omnipony Monster 

The plot of the song is based off of "Discordantly", a comic describing how Discord was once in love with Celestia, and it was her rejection that turned him into a monster.

So beautiful and more than I could ever dream
Somehow I thought you'd see that I wasn't what I seemed
Time went by and I fell so in love with you
Leading myself to believe what wasn't the truth

It feels like I fell asleep
And woke up in a nightmare
Fallen into a world of chaos
You're the reason that I'm here
When you're the only one I've dreamed of
You turned me away
Turning me into the monster I am today

I abandoned order when you broke my heart that day
It then occurred to me chaos is the only way
When all you thought of me is a beast that can't be tamed
The monster that you saw me for is the monster I became

I am not the same
Because of what you did to me
Now I'll show you
That I've become what you thought me to be
If I can't have you then
I'll throw the world away
Only you are to blame
For turning me into the monster I am today...

Aviators and Lectro Dub One Of Us 

The plot of the song is simply Lyra going insane with the obsession of becoming human... I mean, just think about it. What would it be like to be unsatisfied with the creature you are? What if there was something you were so desparate to be, you'd do anything to have that wish granted? It might just drive a pony crazy...

Fabled tales in history
Tell of what she wants to be
Only one of her friends know
And she tries to let it go
So dissatisfied on how
She couldn't change how she turned out
Well kept secrets deep inside
But that passion's hard hide
Wide dismisall as a joke
Pretend to laugh and not provoke
But what if she could get that chance
Experience her life enhanced
At least to her she wouldn't mind
Leaving everything behind
But reality can be so cruel
And she know's the truth

She can't be the one she wants to be
She just wants to look like you and me
Her obsession's not one to discuss
She just wants to look like one of us

Anything she'd sacrifice
To see the world through human eyes
Her desire is one in vain
One that no one can explain
To walk among the legends told
To live in the days of old
She wishes too hard sometimes
For a destiny she'll never find
Despising life within her skin
Hating the place that she's in
Her obsession's dangerous
The need to be one of us
She's lost her identity
Now she craves humanity
It's a disease of the mind
But she knows the truth

Lost something she's trying to find
Looks like now she's lost her mind
She's insane, dangerous
Desperate to be one of us
Locked up in her mental cage
A pony for all of her days
Given up on live itself
Sanity up on the shelf
Oh, she seems to be confused
She's broken, self-abused
Lost inside a wish that simply won't come true
She needs to get it through
That she's not like me and you
She's got to wake up and accept the truth

Eurobeat Brony Discord Aviators Remix 

I'm not a fan of puppeteers but I've a nagging fear
someone else is pulling at the strings
Something terrible is going down through the entire town
wreaking anarchy and all it brings

I can't sit idly, no, I can't move at all
I curse the name, the one behind it all...

Discord, I'm howlin' at the moon
And sleepin' in the middle of a summer afternoon
Discord, whatever did we do
To make you take our world away?

Discord, are we your prey alone,
Or are we just a stepping stone for taking back the throne?
Discord, we won't take it anymore
So take your tyranny away!

I'm fine with changing status quo, but not in letting go
Now the world is being torn apart
A terrible catastrophe played by your symphony,
what a terrifying work of art!

Glaze Heartmender Aviators Remix

It's been WAY too long since I've posted anything. So here's something new, a remix of Glaze's "Heartmender". This was a quick one, but I wanted to do some fun stuff with it and add a new bridge and backing vocals. It turned out not all that different from the original, but it was fun to make. :3 Sadly I'm still sick though, so the vocals aren't all that they could be with my usual voice. I pushed through anyway and decided to stop waiting to get better, because that's taking forever. xD

I'll mend your heart with threads of mine
I'm not a nurse but we'll be just fine
The beats synchronize to force down the wall
On the other side lies my final plane's call

Hold on, I'll be there soon
Just hold on, I'll be there soon
Hold on, I'll be there soon
Just hold on, I'll be there soon

I'm a superhero flying high and free
But I'll lose the powers if it means we'll be
I'll endure the violent winds and the salty air
I'll conquer the sea just for the times we'll share

Please don't think about the past, don't you dare look back now
I'll be here for you always, we'll get out somehow
Sometimes hearts get broken
Dangerous words get spoken
Just hold on I'll be there soon
I'll mend your heart, I'll fix you

Dasha and The Living Tombstone Good Girl Aviators Remix 

Happy Birthday, Tombstone! I have been planning to upload this on his Birthday for a few days now, and then this morning Silva Hound decided to do the exact same thing with the same song. And a better remix. xD Whoops! I've uploaded mine anyway, which is part of my Equestrian Revolution 2.0 album. For those of you who haven't already heard it, enjoy!

I'd like to take a moment to thank Tombstone for everything he's done for me. Back when I was just first starting out, he saw past the obvious flaws in my music and made a remix for me to put on my debut album. I didn't know him, I had just randomly asked him over YouTube after hearing his pony music. I had been a brony for a week or two, so I wasn't really familiar with much of the music community. After his remix was complete, I had a sudden flood of bronies come to my channel. My ten or eleven subscribers quickly grew to fifty, and then to one hundred. I know none of that would have happened without him promoting me and giving my music a chance.

Since that flood of bronies came, I have started creating brony music and have continued to do so for well over a year now. My two-digit subscriber counts have grown into almost thirty thousand. Music has drawn me into this community, and will keep me here for a long time. It's the brony musicians who have helped me develop my skills, and encourage me to keep going. And more than most, Tombstone has always been there to help me out when I need it. Without him, I'm guessing this channel would be long dead, with a couple mediocre pop songs uploaded. In getting me started, he's changed my entire life.

Happy birthday, Tomb. It's an honor to know you.


They took me out of my house
now I have a new home

I gobble pills like a good girl
and I get a new bone

I wiggle around my fake tail
despite how they treat me

They make me feel so alone
even when they're here

So many orders to tell me
I dunno what to do

Chorus:

I wanna run on all fours
just like anyone around me

so I run after my friends
but my friends wanna catch me

I'm not like anyone else
cause they just wanna hurt me, stop me and torture me but that's alright

Cause I know who I am
but still no one believes me, believes me, believes me

Verse 2:

Now I see everyone else
from a small window

They all seem so normal
it feels really shallow

So I wondered why
everyone were against me

I thought that it's normal
to be who I want to be

And they all call me crazy
but I just wished to be free

Chorus:

I wanna run on all fours
just like anyone around me

so I run after my friends
but my friends wanna catch me

I'm not like anyone else
cause they just wanna hurt me, stop me and torture me but that's alright

Cause I know who I am
but still no one believes me, believes me, believes me

Here it is, 7 months in the making and remaking, here is Dasha's first pony related song ever, and I am very happy to bring some Israeli love and make an acoustic song :)

One of the finest productions we did yet...

Heroes Feat Bronyfied 

At long last, after over a year in production, From All Sides is complete. My longest-running and biggest project to date, From All Sides is an album about fighting our own thoughts and inner demons. It's about the darkness within every soul, and the mental battles we fight against ourselves every day. The album is dark, yet has lighthearted moments that bring redemption to the despair of the more hopeless tracks.

This track, Heroes, is the closer to the album, and is among the most epic of pieces I've done. Joining me on the track is Bronyfied with his amazing guitar work, present in my music often since One Last Letter. The song is the only specifically brony-themed song on the album, as it is a song about the transformation the mane 6 have gone through from being ordinary ponies to the heroes they have become thanks to the Elements of Harmony, and their strong friendships. The song is about a final stand, a battle cry as they join together determined to beat the odds and stand against any villain, force, or darkness that they must face. I envisioned Discord as the opponent for this piece, but it's written with an open concept.

The battle ends tonight
It's time to fight our fight
Hoping somehow we'll have the courage to be the
Light in the darkest hour
When things are turning sour
Blind hope is worthless if we all we do is
Wage our wars and fight in vain
Suffer all this worthless pain
We've got to answer a cry for help
The world won't save itself

We can be the heroes, we can dare to save the day
Standing up to those still in our way
With courage we'll keep fighting for
The search we're on for something more
Pushing through until the war is won
We can be the heroes we've become

Too late to be afraid
Now we can't run away
We've got to hold fast and embrace the strength we've
Found in our time of doubt
Somehow we'll make it out
We'll find out who we really are
Tonight we're never going down
It's far too late to turn back now
Not afraid of the perilous
Oh no, we were born for this

Now we'll make it out
We'll stick together and get through this storm somehow
It's too late to back down and run
Hope is gone, but harmony's strong
We've had the power in us all along
To embrace the heroes that we've become

Artattack and Metajoker Still Shy Aviators Remix 

I have changed
I have grown
Now I am
On my own
Knowing now
What is right
I am free
In the light.
Open eyes
Opened heart
Of the world
Now a part
Take a breath
Take a chance
Take a leap
So entranced

(Chorus)
You can't take my hope, my quest, my dream
To fly,
To soar free, forever in the sky
With my new found bravery I will get by
So much stronger than before yet knowing I'm
Still Shy

DROP WUBWUB

(Verse 2)
Open air
On my face
As the clouds
I embrace
Perfect bliss
Terror gone
As my soul
Bursts in song

Ahhh (vocal section)

(Chorus)


(Ending)
You will understand
When you see the sky so grand.
There's no more need to cry
I'm finally alive
Knowing I'm
Still shy. (x2)

Oblivion

Sinners from their homes abroad
Servants of a lesser god
They thought it stood to reason
To crucify their treason
Redemption came from triggers pulled
Young and weak thrown to the wolves
I feel them
I feel them
One in all, and all for some
The desperate carry loaded guns
Peace was lost to violence
The righteous stood in silence
Inaction of those who knew
Betrayed the remaining few
I fear them
I fear them

Let the broken heroes rise
Let the victors take their prize
No one wins when justice dies
War has let this age begin
It's where we've gone and where they've been
What a state that we're in
Here in oblivion

Bitter nightmares, sweetened lies
Genocide was in their eyes
Screams drowned out by cheering
The end was surely nearing
No one dared to take a stand
Eye for eye and hand in hand
I see them
I see them
Puppet strings pulled from above
Money spent to buy more love
Kings in crystal towers
Bring these final hours
Citizens with spirit left
Brought to trial and tried for theft
I'll free them
I'll free them

When the bombs fell, then we knew
The values we believed weren't true
Growing shadows, crimson skies
Hate would win as heroes died
Spared were some, but very few
We paid the price, and so will you
No one's safe tonight
No one's safe tonight
Oblivion awaits us all
We take control, embrace the fall
Making the corrupted right
Chasing after dying light
Change the timeline, change the course
Take them on with damning force
Through fire we're taking flight
Through fire we're taking flight


----------------------------
14

Welcome to Paradise

Where will you be when walls give way
When it's crashing down, and falls away
A wishful thought won't take you far
When hell on earth is where you are
Win or lose you pay the price someday

Welcome to paradise
For thieves and kings alike
The wasteland tolls
Our mortal souls tonight
Game on, it's time to shine
Our lives are on the line
In ruins we strive
We'll never thrive
Without the will to survive

It's a brutal curse to call this home
Where the good men die and evil roams
A thousands lives claimed by this land
The passing cleanse, the fall of man
Do or die, we fight to survive

Where will you be when we rise again
When our enemies will meet their end
It's a whisper turned a battle cry
We're still here 'cuz we refuse to die


----------------------------
15

Apocalypse State of Mind

Where can I bury all of my suffering
Casualties of poison and pride
Where is the line between losing everything
And giving it all to say that you've tried

When I dared to dream of something greater
I flew away into the sky
Nothing's going to fill the space between you and I
And I felt the world grow so much colder
As we drifted away over time
Living in the past in our apocalypse state of mind

Where can I find some kind of a remedy
A cure for my pain, a rest for my eyes
Where can I pray, when nothing means anything
In some kind of cage no God could devise

Now can you hear the sounds of a melody
Playing a tune, to soften our hearts
We can move on past all of the memories
The lapses in faith, that time will impart
Take me to places beyond our biosphere
Into the unknown, where we could reside
Find me in winter when all the paths are clear
In cities of ash, we're healing in time


----------------------------
16

Immortal

We walk along this ashen trail
Through war and fire
They doubted freedom would prevail
We're climbing higher
When the broken call
I will stand up tall
It's all over, there's change in the air
If we fall tonight
We will shine a light
Upon justice, to make this game fair

We are immortal
When destiny reigns
And no one can stop this
Hellbound train
When history listens
Will they know our names?
We are immortal
'cuz Legends remain

We make our own way, we rebuild
The cities razed
Our prophecy is self-fulfilled
For better days
When the broken call
I will stand up tall
It's all over, there's change in the air
If we fall tonight
We will shine a light
Upon justice, to make this game fair

We rise where heroes fell
Inside a man made hell
Through streets of blood and dust
Where weapons turn to rust
We're the fire
We're the change
We're the lost ones
We're the storm
We're the last
Ammunition
Through the smoke
Through the bruised
Fallen brothers
Pushing on
To save all
Of the others


----------------------------

Chaos Theory

When I called you from the darkness
When I whispered in the rain
The cries unheard were cries of my own pain
It's a monster's cell I lived in
When you left me here alone
When you left it all behind and took your throne

Our one last chance
Deliverance
Was thrown away when you
Left me here like the rest
Now it's my time
Vengeance is mine
And here I think I might just
Put my chaos theory to the test

Could you bear to see me like this?
Could you look at what you've done?
You've stepped into a game that can't be won
Now you see what I've been thinking
Now you've stared into the sun
Now I'm going to kill them all, except for one

When broken hearts
Start to fall apart
Malice takes takes hold of the damned
Your words alone
Your heart of stone
Made me into what I am
I'm not insane
I'm victimized
Just scarred and bent on
Burning everything before your eyes
Now watch me do
What I do best
Unafraid of you
I'll put my chaos theory to the test


----------------------------
18

Wolves

I have seen the better days
But now they're far away
Lost beneath the sand
I have lost the ones I knew
And barely made it through
This broken, barren land

Breathing
I embrace the feeling
Of despair that keeps me
Standing on my own
I'm no hero
Starting back at zero
It's an unfair world so
To the wolves I'm thrown
To the wolves I'm thrown

I, the messenger of loss
Have traveled at a cost
To save their legacies
I, the stranger in the wind
A man of many sins
Alone with memories

Will we meet again
Somewhere at the end
Somewhere far beyond this place
It's a hopeless cause
But I'll fight the odds
For a chance to see your face


----------------------------
19

Game Over

Hold your breath we're going under
Taking on the rain and thunder
I would take on anything for you
Split screen co-operation
You are my motivation
I'll watch your back, I always do

We'll make it out alive
We're side by side
When monsters block the way we'll take them down
We're getting closer
Just ahead
We're not out yet
With you I think that we've already won
It's game over

When we have been defeated
No other wins are needed
I'm feeling like a winner next to you
We'll keep on getting stronger
With these battles growing longer
We've got a chance to see this through

Give this level one more try
Make it out before we die
Never let it get the best
We can still complete the quest
Hold me close and watch behind
Look around and you will find
We're halfway to the end already
Take this potion, level two
Now we don't know what to do
Facing new obstacles here
Trying to combat our fear
Game over, we're out of lives
Let's just give it one more try
We've still got each other, baby


----------------------------
20

Ammunition

The broken cities we knew are gone
We're taking the place where we belong
We rise tonight
We're born to fight
Not rebels but defenders
Of our rights
Through clouds of smoke, and the burning skies
Singing out with our freedom cries
We couldn't see
We're meant to be
The soldiers who
Set our brothers free

We are the ammunition
Bullets set on shooting down the lies
This is the acquisition
Taking back the silenced, stolen rights
We're making history tonight

The faces that we wore have changed
We're marching through a nation all too strange
From red and white
To envied green
Words constructed
By the men behind the screen
We take our place now to restore
The purpose that we shared before
Our path ends here
Now make them fear
Our cause to wipe the record clear

When we all
Stand as one
We have power
We can't run
We're taking on a sea of faces
Raise your flags
Lift your voice
Take your side
Make your choice
To move along to better places


----------------------------
21

Who's Going to Stop Me Now?

Here I am, waiting for the outcome
Of a struggle that has grown so tiresome
Whispers in my mind keep taunting me
I believe that I found a purpose
But they say that I don't deserve this
Too late now, the end is where I'll be

We're setting sail tonight
Who knows where we're going
But I will take the chance
Just take my hand and fly
Eyes on the skies ahead now
And never look down
I'm feeling brave here
I see what is coming
And it's been worth the ride
Free of our fears
The end's in sight
Who's going to stop me now?

Break the ice, clear the air, let's get this straight
No one knows how it hurts when they spread hate
Every word cuts deeper than the last
Here I am, left in broken parts now
No one sees how it stings, when you're left out
But we're just pushing on to better days

When the sun won't shine
It's chance for you and I
Sing in the rain, and make the best
We face whatever comes next
We can't give up now
We'll make our mark somehow
Take on the world with no regrets
Our song isn't over yet


----------------------------
22

Meet You At The End

Break my heart and get it done
Take your shot, but don't you run
Away from me again
Away until the end
Take a chance, come back, you're safe
Chemistry you can't erase
From our own paradise
Our cold hearts filled with ice

Nobody wants to walk the road alone
We're ten thousand miles from home
And I don't want to disappear
Where do we go from here?
Nobody wants to play a useless part
In matters of the heart
I'm standing here so far away
I'll meet you at the end someday

Took a chance, you stole my heart
Left me here to fall apart
With you I walked through fire
The flames of our desire
Ghosts of what we used to be
Haunt my mind, and torture me
Voices from the past
Our days are fading fast

I'm breaking
We're fading
But you're not alone
One more try
For tonight
I can't do this on my own
Feels like after all this time
We should have known we'd be here tonight
But I can't let you give up on
Everything we had and we believed was gone
I need you to feel again
Meeting here somewhere at the end
I believe we can start anew
All I need to know is that I stand with you

Losing Control

I'm feeling watched
Like no one's on my side
And I confess
I feel the stress
We've got a problem to address
We're compromised
The truth unknown
A secret kept from me
The worst I fear
With traitors here
Our cause will slowly disappear
Into debris

One of us here's a glitch in the system
Someone's been hiding in plain sight
One of us set the gears in motion
Someone sent from the other side
To break us
Take us
On our knees
To sabotage
The movement we
Uphold
So I've been told
We're losing control

No soul to trust
Suspicions are my own
I won't let go
Until I know
Who's engineered this undertow
The threat unknown
I'll never let
All that we've fought for fall
It's all for naught
Until we've caught
The founder of this evil plot
They'll never take us all

Are you a traitor or have I lost my head
This creeping notion's got me torn into shreds
Is there a spy
Here passing by
Or is there more than meets the eye
I've lost control, I've lost my mind

Acid Rain feat Tarby

Hello, don't be shy
I'll take you to the sky
We'll fly away
To better days ahead
Hello, take my hand
There's poison in the sand
Don't worry I
Can purify
What's dead

I can't let you slip away
The world's in disarray
No one should have to stay
I will take away the pain
When only I remain
To feel the acid rain

Hello, I'm the wind
Guiding as you ascend
So far away
From better days ahead
Hello, I'm the one
The night sky and the sun
I breathe this air
In rivers running red

I'll take you away
To somewhere that the skies aren't quite so gray
I'll be your escape
The stars that lie above us will embrace

Remains 

Human minds
Frail and scared
Freed by death, and death is fair
Hopeless souls
Play a part
In my wicked work of art
Such relief
Every time
Taking life, to take what's mine
At the end
Here we lie
Here we're killers or we die

When the world was turned to gray
The hatred wouldn't go away
Resentment in chains
In the coldest of all hearts
A voice descends, the light departs
Madness remains

Play the game
Paint your scene
Taking this to the extreme
Masterpiece
Dark design
Your last moments, only mine
It's a need
Here in dust
Kill the world that stole from us
Take your place
Let it be
In my crimson symphony

I feel it in my bones
A need to be your god
A need to strike you down
When order disappeared
And madness took control
The conscience in me drowned
I want to be your guide
Into the afterlife
It's a gift, look past the pain like I do
I want to see your eyes
Just before your demise
When only fear remains inside you

Sweet Dreams Bonus Track

Don't mind the noise outside the door
It's just a phantom, nothing more
No need to give yourself a scare
When you glance and no one's there
I don't want to have to hurt you
It's not your fault I felt his rage
Just a child about your age
But something drives me to this place
I can see him in your face
You'll never know the hell I've seen

Don't fear what's coming
We can't fight off the urge inside
It's dark and you're afraid of
The devils that come out at night
Let's make this easy
Soon you'll haunt these beasts you hated
No need for sleep tonight
Sweet dreams are overrated

I'm just a whisper in the void
No one's there, you're paranoid
I'm just a trick of your own mind
Blink your eyes once and you'll find
I'm just a ghost inside your head
Don't fear your fate that soon arrives
It's a deadly lullaby
You'll be with us very soon
Another spirit in the room
Take your place among the lost

You can't wake
From this dream
No one will hear you screaming
So hold on
For the ride
I'll take you with me tonight
This nightmare
This prison
Inside the suits we live in
Don't fear me
Together
We'll have sweet dreams forever

Pinkie's Brew (Remix) - Sherclop Pones

I'll cook up a solution with the knowledge I've accrued
They say a kitch-en time saves nine, but I'm just saving two!
I've gathered the ingredients to make some time sorbet
There's hardly room for seconds when the seconds melt away!

Watch as I work my gypsy magic
Eye of a newt and cinnamon
Watch as the matter turns to batter
open the portal, jump in!

Crude stew, do you fear it Apple Bloom?
Sometimes life is not a cake walk, served up on a silver spoon

Toss a fig and,
save the date and,

bread and butter, chant and mutter,
marination, incantation,
chocolate icing, timeline splicing,
yeast is rising, rectifying

Pinkie if you're hearing this it means we're dead and gone
Please don't bake a portal; just accept it and move on
My cauldron is preheated and I've got you in my thrall
Let's beat these yolks and save my folks by baking the fourth wall!

Watch as I work my gypsy magic
Seapony tears and provolone
God help the outcast with her witchcraft
Someday I'm gonna go home

Someday I'm gonna go home
