Down!, down to the end of the world
Because we're going down!, down to the end of the world
We'll(You'll) never know what- what will happen to us(you)
So we're going down!, down to the end of the wou woah woaah,
*guitar solo*
*clap and voice solo*
Because we're going down!, down to the end of the world
Because we're going down!, down to the end of the world
Because yeah yeah, you'll never know ou oh... yeah you'll never knoow!

Hoje eu acordei, querendo fazer muitas coisas,
E querendo ver, meus amigos legais, 
Por que eu sei que posso contar com eles... sem pensar demais,
*Woah oh solo*
E eu sempre fico feliz, quando, vejo alguem feliz,
E eu vou continuar, vou sempre atrás dessa minha paz,
Sem pensar demais, vou atras, da minha felicidade,
E sei que não há maldade, na nossa amizade,
Eu sei que as vezes o sol, parece mais escuro do que o normal,
Mas não se preocupe, o sol vai clarear seu dia mais uma vez.

If I was a butterfly
I would fly away, without feeling regrets
I would fly away, so I don't feel sad
About not having you by my side

I think, I'm too old, to do these things
I think, I can't hold on anymore
Because you're not giving me attention
But I'm fine, I will be fine

It is always you that can help me
And I'm thankful for that
But I feel that you don't care about me anymore

So I'll ruuun away, like the world is going to end
I'm worse than yesterday, I feel like theres no end
To this bad feeling, I'm fighting more than willing
That, the sun comes up tomorrow

So I will run away, from these bad feelings
I'm tired of feeling lonely
I'm sick of trying to be, what you want me to be
I know, that you don't want me here

So I will run away, like the world is going to end
I will free myself from this pain
That is, not being loved by you


"I'm just procrastinating on a sunday, because I wrote a story yesterday,
Thinking of the feelings of today, I guess I'm never really happy, 
About what I do, I feel that I'm used to, doing nothing all day...
I want to do something productive, but my mind tells me otherwise,
I don't know if I will hold on, I can't take the pain,
And the suffering that comes with... doing nothing all day,
I woke up, see myself in the mirror, I look at me and think,
"Should I keep going like this?",
Sometimes, I just wanna go away, this world is not for me,
and I'm not well today."

And I knooow, I knooow, you're always there for me,
And I knooow, I knooow, I'm always there for you,
Because you're the miracle in my lifee, 
And you're the one I love,
And I knooow, I knooow, You'll always bright my day,
Cause you're the one I love, and you're the one I need,
And you're the one I will protect,
