[Intro: Jaira Burns, Miyeon, Madison Beer, & Jeon Soyeon]
Hey, hey, hey
Hey-hey-hey, hey, hey
You know who it is
Coming 'round again
You want a dose of this
Right now
It’s K/DA, uh!

[Verse 1: Jeon Soyeon & Madison Beer]
I'm a goddess with a blade
소리쳐봐 내 이름 잊지 못하게
(sorichyeobwa nae ireum 
Itji mothage)
Loud, loud, loud, loud
I could take it to the top
절대 멈추지 못해 내가 끝내주는
(Jeoldae meomchuji mothae 
Naega kkeutnaejuneun)
Bad gal, gal, gal
And when I start to talk like that (Like that)
Oh you won't know how to react
I’m a picture-perfect face
With that wild in my veins
You can hear it in my
Growl, growl, growl, growl

[Pre-Chorus: Miyeon]
So keep your eyes on me now
무엇을 보든 좋아할 거야
닿을 수 없는 level
나와 대결 원한 널 확신해
(Mueoseul bodeun joahal geoya 
Daheul su eopneun level 
Nawa daegyeol wonhan neol hwakshinhae)
We got it all in our hands now
So can you handle what we're all about?
We're so tough
Not scared to show you up
Can you feel the rush now?

[Chorus: Jaira Burns, Miyeon, Madison Beer, & Jeon Soyeon]
Ain't nobody bringing us
Down, down, down, down, down, down
They could try but we're gonna wear the crown
You could go another round
Round, round, round, round, round, round
Wish you luck but you're not bringing us down
We go hard (Hard); 'til we get it, get it
We go hard (Hard); we so in it, in it
We pop stars (Pop stars), only winning, winning now
Ain't nobody bringing us down, down, down, down

[Verse 2: Jeon Soyeon & Madison Beer]
Hey!
You ready for this? (Let’s go!)
See 언제든지 내 모습 magic
단 한 번에 내가 잡어
절대 기죽지 않지, uh!
Pow-pow 네가 뭘 알아
견딜 수 없어, 원해도
원하는 게 얼굴에 보여
(See eonjedeunji nae moseub magic 
Dan han beone naega jabeo jeoldae gijukji anchi uh! 
Pow pow nega mwol ara Gyeondil su eopseo, wonhaedo 
Wonhaneun ge eolgure boyeo)
I’m trouble and you're wanting it
I’m so cold
When I move that way, you gonna be so blown
I'm the realest in the game, uh!
Say I'm on fire with a blade
You're about to hear my name
Ringing in your head like, whoa

[Pre-Chorus: Miyeon]
So keep your eyes on me now
무엇을 보든 좋아할 거야
(mueoseul bodeun joahal geoya)
We’re so tough
Not scared to show you up
Can you feel the rush now?

[Chorus: Jaira Burns, MiYeon, Madison Beer, & Jeon Soyeon]
Ain't nobody bringing us
Down, down, down, down, down, down
They could try but we're gonna wear the crown
You could go another round
Round, round, round, round, round, round
Wish you luck but you're not bringing us down
We go hard (Hard); 'til we get it, get it
We go hard (Hard); we so in it, in it
We pop stars (Pop stars), only winning, winning now
Ain't nobody bringing us down, down, down, down

[Bridge]
Oh, 난 멈추지 않아
(nan meomchuji ana)
Oh, oh, we go hard
Oh, oh, we pop stars (Stars), stars (Stars)
Ain't nobody bringing us

[Chorus: Jaira Burns, Miyeon, Madison Beer, Jeon Soyeon]
Ain't nobody bringing us
Down, down, down, down, down, down
They could try but we're gonna wear the crown
You could go another round
Round, round, round, round, round, round
