"Perfect"

Help me forget, these memories of you
And everything that never was
I'll mend from this, with all of my regrets
And all your secrets of the past
There's nothing wrong with me
There's nothing wrong with you
My god we are so perfect

Perfect laugh
Perfect fake
Perfect chance to get away
Perfect love
Perfect hate
My perfect fate that you could obtain
You do anything to make me suffer
But I could not let you go
You're so perfect
Perfect!

You will forget
These memories of me
And everything that could have been
There's nothing wrong with me
There's nothing wrong with you
My god we are so perfect

Perfect laugh
Perfect fake
Perfect chance to get away
Perfect love
Perfect hate
My perfect fate that you could obtain
You do anything to make me suffer
But I could not let you go
You're so perfect
Perfect!

There's nothing wrong with me
There's nothing wrong with you
