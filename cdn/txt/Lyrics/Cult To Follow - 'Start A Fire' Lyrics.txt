Cult To Follow
"Start A Fire"

Make no mistake, I will wait
Till the end of days, Separate
Illusion from my conscious state
You're not safe, you're not safe from me
Clarity, deceptive fake
Offering, protection
From god and my hate
You're not safe, you're not safe from me

A slave to your delusions becoming evident
Leaving my resolution imminent

Undeserving absolution

Think I'll start a fire
I will burn it down
The house with all the liars
The ones who sold us out
Drowning all these memories drenched in gasoline
Our enemies soaked in glycerin
So we light the match and we run like hell
Run like hell, run like hell
So we build a funeral pyre
And start a fire

And here we stand unafraid
Though scars remain. I replace
The victim with mountains of rage
You're not safe, you're not safe from me
So I reject forgiveness
Through eyes of innocence
There's no evasion from your consequence

Undeserving absolution

Think I'll start a fire
I will burn it down
The house with all the liars
The ones who sold us out
Drowning all these memories drenched in gasoline
Our enemies soaked in glycerin
We light the match and we run like hell
Run like hell, run like hell
So we build a funeral pyre
And start a fire

And start a fire
And start a fire
And start a fire

Undeserving absolution

Think I'll start a fire
I will burn it down
The house with all the liars
The ones who sold us out
Drowning all these memories drenched in gasoline
Our enemies soaked in glycerin
So we light the match and we run like hell
Run like... run like hell
Run like hell
Start a fire
Run like hell
Start a fire
