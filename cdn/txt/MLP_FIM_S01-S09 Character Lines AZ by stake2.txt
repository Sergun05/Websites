A. K. Yearling_Another day, another dungeon.
A. K. Yearling_Thanks for reminding me to never give up hope, pinkie.

A. K. Yearling_But i'm glad i realized that even if you're fighting For something good, you're still responsible for your actions.
A. K. Yearling_Easy peazy cheezy.
A. K. Yearling_Hmm. There must be a pattern here.
A. K. Yearling_I already explained everything to the ponyville chronicle.
A. K. Yearling_I based that entire chapter on my experiences here In somnambula.
A. K. Yearling_I can just blend in with all the daring do cosplayers.
A. K. Yearling_I should have known you were just trying to sully my name So that you'd be free to steal whatever you wanted.
A. K. Yearling_I sure didn't.
A. K. Yearling_I'd never have done this without you, rainbow dash.
A. K. Yearling_I'd rather not think about what the others lead to.
A. K. Yearling_I've got bigger problems on my hooves Than dissatisfied fan ponies.
A. K. Yearling_I've got to get this to a museum. thanks for your help.
A. K. Yearling_It doesn't matter.
A. K. Yearling_Just keep your eyes out for anything suspicious.
A. K. Yearling_My last quest took me to a village in southern equestria.
A. K. Yearling_The amulet of culhuacan. and caballeron wants it.
A. K. Yearling_The real treasure is hidden in a lost temple.
A. K. Yearling_They only know daring do.
A. K. Yearling_Those articles seem to make it pretty clear How the villagers feel.
A. K. Yearling_To the pyramid!
A. K. Yearling_What are you all doing here?
A. K. Yearling_Where i started seeing, these.
A. K. Yearling_Which way did they go?
A. K. Yearling_You really think so?
A. K. Yearling_You're right.
A. K. Yearling_what do all these animals have in common?
A. K. Yearling_Actually, no.
A. K. Yearling_I guess having little help can be handy sometimes.
A. K. Yearling_I wouldn't give up hope just yet.
A. K. Yearling_It's crawling with security and if i get into trouble.
A. K. Yearling_It's the only one without a match. how did i miss that?
A. K. Yearling_Not so fast, caballeron!
A. K. Yearling_Phew!
A. K. Yearling_We can't leave without the treasure. And we should probably get to it before our friend Gets any higher.
A. K. Yearling_We're on it!
A. K. Yearling_Weren't you looking for a blindfold?
A. K. Yearling_But the amulet's only a key.
A. K. Yearling_Caballeron wants to sell it to the highest bidder of course.
A. K. Yearling_Either way, i'm done with adventures, having or writing.
A. K. Yearling_I suggest you two take them and head west.
A. K. Yearling_It should.
A. K. Yearling_Oh. it's just you.
A. K. Yearling_Seven doors, seven locks. one of them leads to the treasure.
A. K. Yearling_Since i haven't found the temple yet It's the safest place for me and the amulet.
A. K. Yearling_The ponies there don't know who a.k. yearling is.
A. K. Yearling_The seven sided chest of chicomoztoc.
A. K. Yearling_They don't sell my books in southern equestria.
A. K. Yearling_Uh huh. there's some stairs on the other side of the temple That lead out of the ravine.

A. K. Yearling_You're wrong, caballeron.
A. K. Yearling_i never really thought about the mess i leave behind.
A. K. Yearling_And apparently she does more harm than good.
A. K. Yearling_Everypony i tried to help is mad at me.
A. K. Yearling_I don't think so, dash.
A. K. Yearling_If you really want to know.
A. K. Yearling_No. nothing like that.

Apple Bloom_And I want to get my cutie mark, but I'm no good at selling apples, But I really want to go to the party.
Apple Bloom_And by tomorrow?
Apple Bloom_And even if we do, we could solve it so quick It'll be like it never happened in the first place.
Apple Bloom_And got lost!
Apple Bloom_And she's from manehattan.
Apple Bloom_And that's the reason i asked y'all to come over quick.
Apple Bloom_And what if we never find another one?
Apple Bloom_Are you kidding? I don't want them laughing at us while i'm mixin' potions And accidentally sendin' plants into choking fits!
Apple Bloom_Aw, c'mon, applejack!
Apple Bloom_Big mac!
Apple Bloom_But how can she still not be here?
Apple Bloom_But how could I go to the party if I don't have my cutie mark, Which my big sister says I'm gonna get eventually.
Apple Bloom_But no matter how good our intentions might have been.
Apple Bloom_But they still got Responsibilities.
Apple Bloom_But we don't even have a campfire.
Apple Bloom_But we only did it because we thought you and big mac would be Really happy if you could be Each other's very special Someponies on hearts and hooves day.
Apple Bloom_But we wanted everything to be perfect!
Apple Bloom_But we've been rehearsin' all the live long day!
Apple Bloom_But you said it was a false alarm!
Apple Bloom_But, is that all we're gonna do now?
Apple Bloom_But, miss cheerilee, monday is zap-apple harvest day. And applejack and big macintosh will be too busy to come and speak.
Apple Bloom_Diamond tiara! think hard about the choice you're makin' right now!
Apple Bloom_Did you miss the train?
Apple Bloom_Did you see, Zecora?
Apple Bloom_Exactly but, even when we find problems, We're so good at solving them, that most of the time there's nothing for the cutie mark crusaders to do!
Apple Bloom_Gee, i don't know about this.
Apple Bloom_Girls?
Apple Bloom_Go to the bathroom.
Apple Bloom_Golly, i don't know scootaloo.
Apple Bloom_How, not so well, did things turn out?
Apple Bloom_I don't know.
Apple Bloom_I don't suppose either of you got yours?
Apple Bloom_I guess i figured we'd always do stuff together.
Apple Bloom_I guess so.
Apple Bloom_I guess.
Apple Bloom_I have a cutie mark.
Apple Bloom_I know diamond tiara's been pretty awful but.
Apple Bloom_I know you said sleep is supposed to make me feel better but.
Apple Bloom_I know. that's what i'm worried about.
Apple Bloom_I mean, i got it once, right?
Apple Bloom_I mean, let's face it.
Apple Bloom_I must be the only pony in the universe This worried about her cutie mark.
Apple Bloom_I never even thought about what would happen after.
Apple Bloom_I-I shouldn't. I-I couldn't.
Apple Bloom_I-I.
Apple Bloom_I-i mean uh.
Apple Bloom_It must have been really hard on our parents.
Apple Bloom_Just something i uh, pulled together last minute.
Apple Bloom_Maybe we should head back to the station.
Apple Bloom_No no no!
Apple Bloom_No, or, at least i hadn't.
Apple Bloom_No.
Apple Bloom_No. we're not snitches.
Apple Bloom_Oh no! poor gabby!

Apple Bloom_Oh. ok.
Apple Bloom_Scootaloo and sweetie belle are having nightmares too?
Apple Bloom_She's known about this for weeks!
Apple Bloom_Since, um, earlier today.
Apple Bloom_So, then the cutie mark crusaders Don't have any reason to exist!
Apple Bloom_Sorry. we don't have it anymore.
Apple Bloom_Thanks to you.
Apple Bloom_Then we met these foals who led us to the fair and we tried to give them some grown up style advice.
Apple Bloom_Then you came here because you're sorry And you want to get to know us too?
Apple Bloom_There's just so many things i never considered.
Apple Bloom_Twilight! Fluttershy! Oh Thank goodness! I know you're not gonna believe it.

Apple Bloom_Uh, you are staying here, right?
Apple Bloom_Um, extra?
Apple Bloom_Wait!
Apple Bloom_We just said like two seconds ago that inviting two ponies To twilight time was a big mistake!

Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_The cure for poison joke is a simple old natural remedy.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_The first session's tomorrow.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_The first thing we gotta do, is find your purpose.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_The hippogriffs all once lived happily on mount aris.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_The point is, helping ponies with cutie mark problems Is what makes us special.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_The sheriff sort of has it in his mind that You're a no good outlaw lookin' to shut down the rodeo.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_Then they'll have to let you stay here with us.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_There is no way, no how.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_There's a whole town of possible admirers out there.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_There's how you sell some apples and get a cutie mark.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_They used a magic pearl to turn into sea ponies, and escaped to the underwater safety of seaquestria.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_They were just enjoyin' the show!
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_Think about it, if we saw a rodeo clown doin' What he did back in that shack, We'd think he was the greatest!
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_This ain't wanderin'.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_This is gonna be a lot harder than i thought.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_This is where we do our roll call.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_This is where we eat our lunch.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_This town is full of ponies who have their cutie marks.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_This was kind of your fault.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_To make zap-apple jam with you.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_To talk to both our grandparents.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_Too bad spike isn't here. not that he's very threatening.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_Too summery.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_Trust us, before you know it, You and your puppy will be back to being besties.

Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_Uh, not exactly. seems i'm gonna get to participate after all.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_Um, gabby, i hate to break it to you but.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_Unless, he was being bad at stuff on purpose!
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_Wait, does sugar belle even know you like her?

Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_Wasn't he the pony who took on the dragons?
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_We are earth ponies!
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_We can definitely help you find your purpose But, that mark's probably not gonna happen.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_We can get you some big logs and branches to help build it.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_We didn't mean no harm.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_We just came in to get out of the rain.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_We just gotta show your parents we're a set of three.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_We know exactly where we're headed, to find trouble shoes!
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_We know you wanna change and, we think we can.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_We only need to find him. we don't need to capture him.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_We wanted to go to twilight's school more than anything.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_We were thinkin' of putting together A cutie mark summer camp.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_We would, but we've got some major crusaders business planned for today.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_We'll just avoid her like the plague until she goes home.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_We're not going!
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Noisy_We're saying that since you can do everything So amazingly well.

Apple Bloom_Neutral_Very Noisy_This column is a little softer than our usual gossip.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Very Noisy_Too, shiny.

Apple Bloom_Neutral_Very Noisy_What i meant was, we should write for the paper!
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Very Noisy_What if the three of us work together To find out who we are and what we're supposed to be?
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Very Noisy_When ponyville started the derby.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Very Noisy_Why don't we ask them how they did it?
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Very Noisy_Why not?
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Very Noisy_Will do!
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Very Noisy_Wow. when you put it that way, it doesn't sound so fun.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Very Noisy_Yeah, i know all about them.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Very Noisy_Yeah. and just a tiny bit more Lace.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Very Noisy_Yeah. so pretty sure critter-sitting cutie marks are out.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Very Noisy_Yep. everywhere you look, There's a pony we've helped find a purpose.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Very Noisy_Yes, fluttershy.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Very Noisy_You got the canteens?
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Very Noisy_You got your cutie mark all wrong, trouble shoes!
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Very Noisy_You know what?
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Very Noisy_You mean granny wasted her money?
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Very Noisy_You mean the cutie mark that's runnin' right off your flank?
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Very Noisy_You sure that's bad luck? seems like maybe you're just a little, um.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Very Noisy_You'd have to be crazy not to get a bushel of your very own.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Very Noisy_You've gotta admit, we've had a pretty good effect On everypony since we discovered Our destiny.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Very Noisy_You, sir!
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Very Noisy_and nuthin' and nopony is gonna move us, no matter.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Very Noisy_and, less rickety.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Very Noisy_do they want to be crusaders?
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Very Noisy_excellent.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Very Noisy_exclusive, local dragon tells all.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Very Noisy_i don't think i did it right.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Very Noisy_it was.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Very Noisy_make sure the hats and bows closet is fully stocked.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Very Noisy_y'see, i'm actually three little fillies.
Apple Bloom_Neutral_Very Noisy_yep.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__A little more magic practice and lifting brooms'll be a cinch.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__About that blue plant.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Absolutely.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Actually, i was kinda thinking of something A little more modern.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Actually, yeah.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Ah.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__All right but, where do we even start?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__All right, scootaloo's gonna pretend to take Sugar belle's things.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__An', i always know you're gonna be here when i need you.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__And I'm sure I can learn a lot more but.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__And Spur probably should share Bloofy.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__And all those worries Twilight and the others had don't apply anymore. Because we're big!
Apple Bloom_Neutral__And bein' big is all it takes.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__And even if our carts aren't exactly what we had in mind.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__And even though we seem like grown ups, you were way more responsible than us.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__And even though we're all a little scared, A cutie mark won't change who we are Or how everypony feels about us.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__And i know just the place, Applejack used to go there when she was little.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__And i want you to answer honestly.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__And i'll be a pirate spy. arrgh, a spyrate!
Apple Bloom_Neutral__And i'm the main dancer.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__And lotta hard work!
Apple Bloom_Neutral__And our train tickets are all set.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__And scootaloo, you're great at maneuvers on your scooter.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__And that's something every heart desires.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__And you don't need a symbol on your flank to know that.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__And, even though scootaloo thinks bungee jumping Is the bees knees.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__And, you always will be.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Anything yet?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Applejack and i do it every year.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Applejack told me about her bakery.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Applejack, is it okay if i get going?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Applejack, you are not gonna believe the dream i just had.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Apples from fillydelphia, tall tale town, And all the apples from appleloosa.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Are you girls thinking what i'm thinking?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Are you making another delivery to starlight's old village?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Are you sure you're not Twilight's sister?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Are you sure you're not just upset you have to share him?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Are you sure?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__As a grown up, it'll be a snap.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Attempts to impress you if we hadn't put him up to it.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Babs won't be able to resist wanting to ride in it.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Back already?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Back to the business of earnin' our cutie marks.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Besides, I've been through a swamp as a young pony.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Better?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Big mac never would have gone through with all of those crazy.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Boy, i sure would hate to be afraid of swimming.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__But at least we still have the club.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__But bungee jumping sounds just as scary As crochet sounds boring.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__But i think the most important thing i learned Is who really runs sweet apple acres.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__But i was too caught up in myself to listen.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__But if it really does work, We could make everypony in town happy.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__But it er.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__But stuff that brings the good.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__But then we thought of you.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__But we all ended up with carts That are what each of you wanted.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__But we learned our lesson.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__But we think we know why.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__But whenever Zecora comes to town, all the shops are mysteriously closed.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__But, Applejack says that.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__But, he was so shy, he couldn't bring himself to perform.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__But, i ran into grand pear yesterday and he was real nice.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__But, i'm pretty sure scoot and rainbow dash Will take that award.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__But, maybe we just skip the whole obstacle course thing and call it a day.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__But, the more we do it, the better we get at camping.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__But, uh, speakin' of the rodeo.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__But, uh, we're not confused. We're just.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__But, what do we do until then?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Careless.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Cause i'm not goin' anywhere.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Come on!
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Come on, We didn't come all this way for nothin'.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Come on, rumble. that's not how cutie marks work.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Dear princess celestia, Waiting for what your heart desires can be really hard.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Did you find out what's in the tonic?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Do you think theirs'll be even better than ours?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Doesn't mean we shouldn't care about hers.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Don't worry big mac, we learned our lesson the hard way.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Don't worry pip.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Earth ponies.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Even though he really, really wanted to.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Even though i'm an apple.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Everypony's really enjoyed it.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Exactly.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Exactly.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Finding you and learning all about mom and dad.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__First order of business, helpin' my big brother decorate the barn for his big date with sugar belle tonight and.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Friendship means pitching in to help others' chores go faster.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Go on!
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Golly.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Good night, fluttershy.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Granny couldn't swim before and now she can.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Granny said that the water needs.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Granny, have you seen Big Mac?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Hammer.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__He ain't here. Let's go.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__He just didn't know how to do it.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__He seems okay meetin' us.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__He thought his cutie mark was telling him to keep away from rodeos, But deep inside he knew it's where he was meant to be.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__He wanted to be by himself.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Heck, you'll do a whole obstacle course In high heels if you think it'll get me somethin' i want.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Hello!
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Helping others.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Hey!
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Hey! i've seen that flower blooming in ponyville.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Hey, big mac?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Hey, it's no big deal.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Hey, what's going on here?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Hmm.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Hmm.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Hmm.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Hmm.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Hold that thought.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Hoo eee! those ribbons are the bees' knees.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__How are we gonna find our special talent in our sleep?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__How do you make up your mind which one to stay in?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__How do you think cousin orchard blossom would describe this sunset?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__How often do you get to spend time with your sister?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Huh, that would make more sense.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I can understand why it's hard for you to decide.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I don't get what you mean.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I don't know what Spur's so worried about. Bloofy and Biscuit are havin' fun.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I don't suppose you asked Rarity?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I don't think that's it, scoot.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I don't think that's the problem.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I don't wanna be late for my crusaders meeting.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I feel like i found a piece of me I didn't even know was missing.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I guess i do have a family tradition to uphold.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I had a dream once i was an apple.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I happen to know for a fact That applejack gave you a gem to watch winona.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I hope you brought the tickets, We've gotta hurry if we're going to make the train.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I just can't believe all the things that flim flam tonic can do!
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I just don't understand why you went So crazy there at the end of the race.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I know we all got pretty anxious when we found out Babs got her cutie mark.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I know what this is.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I know you mean well, but i don't need you watchin' over me.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I know!
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I mean, i did?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I mean, i know you like to win an' all, but.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I mean, that's somethin' a grown up would say, right?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I must admit it's kinda fun to see them working hard To get on our good side for a change!
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I only wish i'd realized what you needed right away.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I really appreciate all the effort, big ma, cousin orchard blossom.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I really like maud.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I think i got to just stick to punches and kicks.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I think my brother has a crush!
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I thought you were gonna help me get ready For the filly guide cookie drive.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I will show you who is the one who is careless.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I wish it would happen all at once.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I won't let you down.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I'd say it's either a friendship problem or a monster attack.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I'm Apple Bloom, Nice to meet you.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I'm apple bloom.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I'm apple bloom.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I'm big mac's little sister.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I'm going to ask you a very personal question.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I'm not much of a dancer.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I'm ready for this.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I'm ready!
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I'm sure she's not but, it's like applejack said.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I'm telling you, this pony really likes her apples.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I've been thinkin' crusaders.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__I-i don't have a cutie mark.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__If only there was a way we could help A whole herd of 'em at once.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__If we can write a few more of these gabby gums columns,.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__If we hadn't, i might have never even tried dancing.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__In a word, yes.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__In, seaquestria.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Instead of moping around for no reason.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Is it?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Is too!
Apple Bloom_Neutral__It looks an awful lot.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__It may as well be.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__It seemed so real.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__It sure is a lot of fun and, i'm pretty confident I can only get better.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__It was a warning.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__It was my fault that map gone all wet.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__It'll still be fun to drive them to the finish line.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__It's a potion i mixed up from zecora's book.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__It's about doing something that means something special To that.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__It's called poison joke.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__It's got an evil claw!
Apple Bloom_Neutral__It's still school, right?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__It's true.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Just 'cause she's never cared about anypony else's feelings.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Just a dash and a drop and a drip.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Just ask applejack.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Just like, you couldn't walk, and now you can.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Just try and make him feel comfortable.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Learning about our parents.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Let's head back to the farm and wait. Big Mac is sure to show up soon.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Look!
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Look, we're here.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Look. i know our cutie marks are amazing.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Looky here, Twilight, that pot of water wasn't for me.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Mainly because it looked like something You couldn't do alone but, i wasn't very good at it.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Maybe not just us.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Maybe that's our special talent, arguing.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Maybe the feud was a misunderstanding or something, a-And we can fix it?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Maybe we should wait until we wake up.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Mm hmm.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__My cutie mark is so unbelievably amazing.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Mysterious package, smudged address, no idea who it's from.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__No it isn't, it's a swell idea.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__No ma'am.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__No risk, no reward!
Apple Bloom_Neutral__No, our sisters are still gone.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__No, that's crazy. i think it's my broccoli thing.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Nope, i think rumble's already picked out a box.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Now how we gonna do this?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Now that we're all together, There's something we want to show you.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Obviously, she's just been ordering a lot of apples.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Of course, i'm allergic.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Oh hey! is that the toy we used to play with when i was little?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Oh wait! now i know how to call a chicken.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Oh, and how could i forget.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Oh, good.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Oh, i'm sorry, miss cheerilee, but she got called out of town On account of a family emergency.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Oh, nothin'.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Oh, okay.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Oh, so maybe we can redesign it then.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Oh, wait, i already told you that, didn't i?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Oh, yeah, that makes much more.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Oh.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Oh.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Oh.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Oh. well, i guess that changes things.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Ok but, that grand pear was really nice to me.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Okay then, um.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Okay, crusaders!
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Okay, number one seventy two. make sure to pump the bellows to keep the stove warm.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Or should I say, pear posal.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Probably not.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Prune is only one of the ingredients.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Really?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Really? even after we messed it up?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Remember the first time we came here And rarity had that ginormous tent?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Right at the end of the song!
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Right behind you, pinkie pie!
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Right, right.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Right.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Right?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Scootaloo says this whole thing is your fault.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__She does make a pretty good point.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__She says it's a pair of scissors.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__She wants to change but, she doesn't know how.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__She'll want to know about this.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__She's sweet once you get to know her.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Show's about to start.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Since we're such great advice givers, feel free to ask us for more.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__So what other costumes did you bring, sweetie belle?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__So when's Rainbow Dash comin'?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__So you may try to take a shortcut.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__So you should do the choreography.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__So, i thought we should start figuring out ways To search all of equestria for cutie mark problems!
Apple Bloom_Neutral__So, pip, how would you help the school If you were elected student pony president?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__So, we're good?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Some of the chickens may have escaped.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Somepony needs to put this thing out of its misery.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Something in this here applesauce smells kinda fishy.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Sorry everypony, we're closin' up shop. Glad to help you out tomorrow.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Sounds like we're all going to try something different.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Sounds to me like rumble isn't afraid Of being put in a box at all.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Spike, you comin'?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Sure, i'm sure!
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Sure, if there were hundreds of apples in a bunch of different lines.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Sure.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Sweetie belle and scootaloo, cousin orchard blossom.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Sweetie belle says it's your fault that terramar ra.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Sweetie belle would rather keep bees.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Sweetie belle, i think you should be the singer.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Terramar's right, sweetie belle.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Thanks applejack.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__That must be sugar belle.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__That'll be four bits.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__That's everything on applejack's list.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__That's granny smith. gotta run!
Apple Bloom_Neutral__The apples usually do but, honestly.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__The first post cutie mark meeting Of the cutie mark crusaders is now in session!
Apple Bloom_Neutral__The important thing to remember Is that there is no rush.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__The only cure is being honest with yourself and others.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__The way they're huddled up like that.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Then i guess we should ask granny?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Then we'd know everything we need to get to the fair and back with no problem.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__There has got to be a better solution!
Apple Bloom_Neutral__There you are. i've been looking all over.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__There'll be more sisterhooves socials down the line.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__There's not much we can do from this room.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__There's some soup for you in the refrigerator.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__These are their traditions.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__This is sweetie belle and scootaloo.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__This isn't a curse.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__This meeting of the cutie mark crusaders Is now in session.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__This really is a good spot for thinking up great ideas.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__This special hearts and hooves day meetin' of the cutie mark crusaders is now in session!
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Three kinds of ponies living together as friends, just like us!
Apple Bloom_Neutral__To find our cutie marks.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Tomorrow? what for?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Trust me.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Turns out my long lost cousin.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Uh, applejack?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Uh, are you sure about that?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Uh, could you excuse us for a moment?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Um, she's a sea pony.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Unless we become cutie mark crusader cottage cleaners.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__We all are.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__We can't just waste this opportunity To find out what our special talents are.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__We did. we wanted your help to build our carts.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__We do exactly what we got our cutie marks in.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__We end up helpin' other ponies figure out their true talent!
Apple Bloom_Neutral__We have a bit of a reputation for gettin' carried away.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__We have it handled.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__We need all the help we can get.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__We need to be able to buy them some things.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__We only got a few hours before morning And this thing has to look so good.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__We should probably make sure she's okay.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__We spend an awful lot of time fussin' and frettin' tryin' To discover our true talent, but when we take a little time off.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__We take cash or credit.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__We want you to know that we are here to help.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__We'll take it.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__We're coming all the way to the crystal empire Without looking around.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__We're gettin' tired.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__We're headed to the fair too.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__We've already asked Applejack, Rainbow Dash.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__We've never tried gettin' our cutie marks in campaign managin'!
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Weird. gabby didn't show twilight her mark Like she said she was gonna do?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Well don't just stand there. Come on!
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Well that doesn't make a lick of sense.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Well you're in luck.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Well, all right.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Well, he did.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Well, howdy um, gabby.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Well, i kind of liked dancing.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Well, if it doesn't matter to you then it doesn't matter to me either sis.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Well, if we can't buck 'em, let's just pick 'em.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Well, it's looking like cutie mark problems Are few and far between.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Well, now at least i can see.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Well, now you do.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Well, that's silly!
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Well, this dishonesty never works, Because you didn't earn what your heart desired.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Well, twist doesn't have hers yet.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Well, yeah.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Well, you have been talking about it pretty much every day since then.

Apple Bloom_Neutral__Yep.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__Yep. all good things come to those who wait.

Apple Bloom_Neutral__You always wanted to be part of a rodeo, right?

Apple Bloom_Neutral__You can use your magic to make my cutie mark appear.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__You can't catch me!
Apple Bloom_Neutral__You can't out fight dragons.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__You don't have a cutie mark.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__You don't need to apologize for caring about How other ponies are feelin'.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__You dressin' up as my cousin orchard blossom Was a pretty crazy idea in the first place.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__You have tonics that heal all sorts of ailments.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__You just got to take a bubble bath.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__You know there's no such thing as a curse.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__You know, When I'm lookin' for somethin', Granny says it's best to check the least likely place.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__You know, i just might.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__You know, when I'm lookin' for somepony, Granny says it's best to just stay in one place.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__You must be new.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__You sure about that?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__You sure have some great memories of these reunions, don't you?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__You told me that you wanted to perform more than anything.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__You wanna tell me what's goin' on?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__You were right applejack.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__You'd think we would be used to stuff like this in Ponyville.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__You're amazing on that scooter.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__You're just chicken.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__You're my big brother.
Apple Bloom_Neutral__You're not using power tools, are you?
Apple Bloom_Neutral__You're supposed to be sharing him.

Apple Bloom_Sad_Noisy_Babs may have run us out of town.
Apple Bloom_Sad_Noisy_But, this cutie mark sure isn't what i was hoping for.
Apple Bloom_Sad_Noisy_Even when we were terrible. now it's just terrible.
Apple Bloom_Sad_Noisy_Give me a break.
Apple Bloom_Sad_Noisy_He wouldn't come.
Apple Bloom_Sad_Noisy_I can't even spin right.
Apple Bloom_Sad_Noisy_I feel like i have four left feet.
Apple Bloom_Sad_Noisy_I guess we aren't creature catchers.
Apple Bloom_Sad_Noisy_I just won't go to the party.
Apple Bloom_Sad_Noisy_I really don't see how that's supposed to make me feel better.
Apple Bloom_Sad_Noisy_I want it now!
Apple Bloom_Sad_Noisy_I'll never find something I'm good at!
Apple Bloom_Sad_Noisy_I'm gonna be as old as granny smith And still have a blank flank.
Apple Bloom_Sad_Noisy_It is?
Apple Bloom_Sad_Noisy_It probably means that being the last one in your class to get a cutie mark runs in the family.
Apple Bloom_Sad_Noisy_It's just not fair!
Apple Bloom_Sad_Noisy_Just like babs seed.
Apple Bloom_Sad_Noisy_Maybe that's just it. maybe we can only help ponies.
Apple Bloom_Sad_Noisy_Mind if we join ya?
Apple Bloom_Sad_Noisy_No, it won't.
Apple Bloom_Sad_Noisy_No.
Apple Bloom_Sad_Noisy_Oh, please, please, please, please.

Apple Bloom_Sad_Noisy_Well there ain't gonna be a scootaloo.
Apple Bloom_Sad_Noisy_Well, i got mine but, my friends didn't get theirs and now there's all kinds of trouble.
Apple Bloom_Sad_Noisy_Well, we didn't want a quitter.
Apple Bloom_Sad_Noisy_When she couldn't do it, she told us that she was quitting.
Apple Bloom_Sad_Noisy_Why not, got nothin' better to do.
Apple Bloom_Sad_Noisy_Worst family road-trip. Ever.

Apple Bloom_Sad_Noisy_we should have never meddled in Your relationship.
Apple Bloom_Sad_Very Noisy_Blank?
Apple Bloom_Sad_Very Noisy_Guess I'm not cut out to be a baker either.
Apple Bloom_Sad_Very Noisy_Guess what we're trying to say is.
Apple Bloom_Sad_Very Noisy_Hey crusader, how's it goin'?
Apple Bloom_Sad_Very Noisy_I guess so.
Apple Bloom_Sad_Very Noisy_I just got to fix this.
Apple Bloom_Sad_Very Noisy_I just have to face it. I'm gonna have a blank flank forever!
Apple Bloom_Sad_Very Noisy_I mean, if i was a blank flank again, There wouldn't be a problem.
Apple Bloom_Sad_Very Noisy_I told you this was a terrible idea.
Apple Bloom_Sad_Very Noisy_I'm doomed.

Apple Bloom_Sad_Very Noisy_Sorry.
Apple Bloom_Sad_Very Noisy_Thanks.
Apple Bloom_Sad_Very Noisy_What!
Apple Bloom_Sad_Very Noisy_Yeah, she's right.
Apple Bloom_Sad_Very Noisy_it's not fair!

Apple Bloom_Sad__All we wanted to do was make up for messin' things up the last time.
Apple Bloom_Sad__Alright, well.
Apple Bloom_Sad__And we really and truly did enjoy learning New skills with you.
Apple Bloom_Sad__Applejack's.
Apple Bloom_Sad__Applejack's.
Apple Bloom_Sad__Aren't you gonna stay for brunch?
Apple Bloom_Sad__Aw.
Apple Bloom_Sad__But Big Mac's old enough to take care of himself and, we'd all have so much fun together.
Apple Bloom_Sad__But i'm awful sorry i lied, especially to you gals.
Apple Bloom_Sad__But, i'm sure our older sisters know what they're doing, right?
Apple Bloom_Sad__Don't send us home! it's not fair!

Apple Bloom_Sad__I just forgot that for a little while.
Apple Bloom_Sad__I know.
Apple Bloom_Sad__I know.
Apple Bloom_Sad__I want one right now!
Apple Bloom_Sad__I was so desperate for my cutie mark, I just got carried away.
Apple Bloom_Sad__I wish we didn't have to.

Apple Bloom_Sad__It will be the worst night of my life.
Apple Bloom_Sad__It's hopeless. hopeless!

Apple Bloom_Sad__There's no way I'm going to that.
Apple Bloom_Sad__They all are.
Apple Bloom_Sad__They'll just laugh some more!
Apple Bloom_Sad__We did everything real grown ups told us not to and.
Apple Bloom_Sad__We felt like it was all our fault.
Apple Bloom_Sad__We know.
Apple Bloom_Sad__We never did anything to you.
Apple Bloom_Sad__We're sorry for everything we put you through today, Sugar belle.
Apple Bloom_Sad__Who'd have thought it would be so hard To find something for us all to do together?
Apple Bloom_Sad__Why, i wouldn't blame you If you never wanted me to come by again.
Apple Bloom_Sad__Worst hearth's warmin' ever.
Apple Bloom_Sad__Y'all are the best.

Applejack_Annoyed_Noisy_An extra hour of work, pickin' apples off the ground.
Applejack_Annoyed_Noisy_And how'd you figure that?
Applejack_Annoyed_Noisy_And i bet modest is not one of them.

Applejack_Annoyed_Noisy_And i'm pretty sure there's another friendship problem here And i'm gonna search this resort top to bottom till i find it.
Applejack_Annoyed_Noisy_And in the meantime, this pest and his vermin friends, are gonna go after my prized apple!
Applejack_Annoyed_Noisy_And now they're supposed to bust their rumps again Just 'cause some buffalo won't stampede someplace else?
Applejack_Annoyed_Noisy_Apple Bloom, hush and let the big ponies talk.

Applejack_Annoyed_Noisy_But it's my opinion.
Applejack_Annoyed_Noisy_But telling ponies your tonic can do things it can't is just wrong!
Applejack_Annoyed_Noisy_But this don't change the fact that tryin' to make this delivery on your own was a plum crazy thing to do.

Applejack_Annoyed_Noisy_Dag nabbit.
Applejack_Annoyed_Noisy_Don't any of y'all talk?
Applejack_Annoyed_Noisy_Don't blame me, Rainbow dash should've flown up there and shut it. After all, she's got wings.
Applejack_Annoyed_Noisy_Don't count your pictures before they're snapped, rainbow dash.
Applejack_Annoyed_Noisy_Don't worry. we know exactly whose fault it was.

Applejack_Annoyed_Noisy_I'll consider talking to them again.
Applejack_Annoyed_Noisy_I'll give ya one guess whose side is still standin.'.
Applejack_Annoyed_Noisy_I'm afraid svengallop doesn't give A pickled pippin about your charity work.

Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_You may be a tad old, granny, But you're as feisty and full of spark as ever.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_You moan a few times, he leaves, and this whole thing is over.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_You must be Goldie Delicious.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_You must have noticed how you aren't bad anymore.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_You packed bug spray?
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_You really think winnin' some canoin' record is gonna get you that teacher of the month trophy?
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_You see, rockhoof, was a tiny little fella.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_You should've seen her fire up those students to build a shed.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_You sure did.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_You sure you're okay?
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_You two go on and take care of the costumes.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_You want to go right, we'll go right.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_You'll feel right at home.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_You'll see.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_You're a nacho away from no rolleycoaster!
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_You're gonna have to redo that schedule.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_You're looking sweatier than a Pig wrangler on a summer's day.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_You're never too old to be a filly.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_You're only allowed to eat rock soup for dinner.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_You're right.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_You're sayin' the great seedling is taking our apples?
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_You're the best gosh darn party planner in equestria.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_You've been doing a whole lot of taking, But you haven't been doing a whole lot of giving.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_You've been plannin' this shindig for weeks.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_Your fellow apples are waiting for you to join them.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_Your humble subject, applejack.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_Your mane looks fine.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_Your style speaks for itself.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_a distraction's a distraction.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_all it'll take now is a few days of hard work.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_all right. how about this? if you help me with the harvest today, I'll help you set traps for the great seedling tonight.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_and as long as it's only an hour.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_and if it means beating appleloosa, I'll give either one of you my spot on the team Quicker than granny smith can core an apple.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_and soon, apple chord was playin' real shows.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_and then they carried granny smith across the street.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_and we swap 'em without knowin' whose is whose.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_and we've got some pretty strong opinions on this spell of yours.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_and when y'all are done that, Feel free to have some popcorn for dessert.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_and, easy.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_apple bloom, you haven't hunted for the Great seedling since you were little.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_aw Don't feel bad, rainbow. it's all in good fun.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_aw, shucks, rarity. i guess i missed the whole day.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_back on the farm.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_because this here shovel says otherwise.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_besides.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_big mac wasn't harvesting the carrots.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_but i reckon if we keep watch over the trees That haven't been bucked.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_but in that moment, i knew i had to be honest.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_but it looks like somepony's gettin' themselves all worked up over nothin'.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_but it's finally here.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_but rockhoof wouldn't take no for an answer.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_but she missed playin' for her family.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_but, that last bit's awful smudged.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_by the wind maybe.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_careful there, partner.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_cause that's the kind of tried and true friend i am.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_clap your hooves if you know 'em. and a one and a two and a.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_come on, girls. there's no reasonin' with that one.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_count me in.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_did you even know there were royal street carpeters?
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_don't forget we have actual work to do too!
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_er, we're fillin' in for their majesties.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_friendship quests beyond equestria?
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_gah! land sakes! is it time for our spa day already?
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_got to hand it to the girl, That mare do well sure can pull off some pretty heroic feats.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_granny's right.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_ha! now, what do we have here?
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_he started digging a trench.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_he was just up late working out a new schedule So we can stay on track.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_hold on a second now!
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_honestly, i don't know if there's gonna be a crystalling.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_i guess there's no harm in her hunting the great seedling for a day, right?
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_i hope you don't think you're the only one To find her artifact.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_i hope you're ready to cheer apple bloom up When her traps come up empty.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_i just hope twilight and spike can handle things until i get back.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_i know we've only got an hour but, i can't wait to have a steam.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_i know what you mean, rarity.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_i know you're excited, But we sure could use your help today.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_i know. you're right. i really am glad we're doing this.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_i'm sure everything will be just fine.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_i've been putting work before our spa time for too long.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_if Pinkie's a twichin', you better listen.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_is something you never grow out of.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_it's been a long time since i was on A real seedling hunt, and this is the first time doing it with my little sister.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_it's obvious you're an Apple to the core.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_it's part of the ponyville dance tradition.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_kinda looks like those seedling tracks, huh?
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_knowing you? nope.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_let's try something a little simpler.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_maybe.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_me too.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_might not even be real?
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_more buckets of apples, more oil, wood for the fire.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_nopony! that's who!
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_not apple at all. the apples win most traditional.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_nowhere else i'd rather be.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_oh don't you worry about twilight.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_oh i can guarantee Rockhoof was as real as you and me.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_ok. this list pretty much covers everything you need to know to feed the pigs.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_or animals.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_pick an apple a day and keep trouble away.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_preposterous.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_rockhoof, got visibly stronger!
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_setting traps is one thing.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_she's a few apples short of a bushel.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_she's a friend of mine From winona's sheep herdin' competitions, wrangler.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_she's so creative.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_signed, your loyal subjects.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_so i decided right then and there, i was too old to waste any more time on the great seedling.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_so you knew what those critters were all along, huh pinkie pie?
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_steady, steady.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_sure is great to hear miss pommel is doing so well.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_sure thing spike.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_sweetie belle, apple bloom, and scootaloo.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_thanks y'all. i guess i just got so used to doing everything a certain way.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_that's just an ordinary village full of ordinary pony folk.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_the confluence. a harvest a hundred moons in the making.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_then Let's get moving, y'all.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_then one fateful day.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_there wasn't even any traffic!
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_they'll be along in a bit. for now it's just you and me.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_uh jee. thanks. granny smith always said.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_uh, right.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_uh, sure i guess.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_we could sure use some more muscle.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_we don't always see eye to eye.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_we fell behind a bit yesterday So we need everypony at their best.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_we felt exactly the same way When twilight told us she was reopening the school.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_we're goin' to learn about you.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_we're grateful for all the help we can get.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_well, with a harvest this big.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_what can we help y'all with?
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_when i got my cutie mark, I saw a rainbow that pointed me home.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_who's with me?
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_why we're all here.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_why, I can tell you every little thing there's to know about the history of apples.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_wish i could, but granny big mac and apple bloom, all have chores of their own.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_with that beard, I reckon you're some sort of country music singer.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_word of her talent spread.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_wow! those are all the places we went When we left to save equestria!
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_yeah, amazing.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_you know what sugar cube?
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_you know, this all could've been avoided If y'all just came to me in the very beginning.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_you solved that triangley thing mighty fast.
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_you sure you wanna go through with this?
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_you tried the crystal empire fritters yet?
Applejack_Neutral_Noisy_young rockhoof wanted nothing more than to be part of the mighty helm.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_'fraid so, scootaloo.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_A long time ago.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Absolutely not.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Actually, the other ponies' problems Seem to be good for gladmane too.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Ah, that's her.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_All right climb up here and i'll cover you up.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_All right everypony, step right up, take a seat.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_All right! that's it for today, y'all!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_All right, then.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_All right, winona. time for your brushin'.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_All we have to do is solve our friendship problem And get back home.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_All yours, partner.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Allright, everypony. let's talk turkey!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Alright, alright. there there.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_And anypony related to twilight is practically family.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_And bloomberg here is one of my favorites.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_And catch as many balls as possible for their team.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_And even though it's already an apple family favorite.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_And even with princess celestia leadin' the charge.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_And help me move the one big thing in here that actually matters!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_And i don't know anypony who's that interested in farming.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_And i know you gonna love it.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_And i packed you a basket of nice fresh apples in case you get hungry.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_And if i'm telling you he said it, You know it's the absolute truth because.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_And if it weren't for you wanting to show even those Two con ponies kindness.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_And it ain't even saucin' season!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_And it didn't take long for him to force every one of his subjects To fight for him against equestria.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_And leave the driving to these stallions.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_And my old time cart is a rootin' tootin' wreck!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_And neither are all these crazy plants.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_And pinkie pie was just about as helpful As a weasel in a hen house.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_And scaring fluttershy is just lazy.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_And she's modest and humble.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_And some fritter making and quilting for the not so young 'uns.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_And start doing what we can!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_And that just sucked the fun right out of the game for you.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_And their friendship drove them nasty critters away.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_And there's lots more to come after that.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_And tomorrow, we open presents!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_And we will make it to the games once everypony carbo loads on my apple brown betties.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_And you've got a big brother to go congratulate.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Apple bloom!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Apple bloom, you've never met babs seed, remember?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Apple bucking day, take two.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Applebloom!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Applebloom? applebloom!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Are you sure the wagon's strong enough to hold it all?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Are you sure this is what twilight would want?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_As long as you have somethin' To lay in so you can look at it.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_At first, i didn't think i'd be much help, But thank goodness i signed on!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Aw, she was probably just trying to spare my feelings.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Being honest sure gets hard when it seems like the truth might hurt somepony you care about.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Best darn bitesize apple fritter you ever tasted?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Better pick up the pace on these fritters though huh?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Big mac can make time in the schedule for us To set traps, right?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Big mac told me, with a whole lotta power, Comes a heckuva lot of responsibility.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Big mac, you're up!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Bloomberg's a big and strong apple tree.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Both the trapeze show and the animal act would be better off If they left, but everypony is so busy arguing that they can't.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_But bloomberg's the whole reason we're making this trip.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_But everypony seems to be getting along just fine.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_But good things are better when they're a rarity.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_But i know i'd feel a heap better if i could just check on applebloom one last time.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_But i sure ain't one of them.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_But i think believing a lie, can end up hurting even more.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_But it taught me a lifelong lesson about being honest.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_But las pegasus is a wild vacation spot.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_But now i have some chores that need tending to so, see you later.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_But starlight's in charge at the school.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_But then, the icy chill of the windigoes almost iced up everythin'.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_But there's no reason to hide When you don't do as well as You'd hoped.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_But who in tarnation is pinkie bow and flutterdash?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_But y'all need to get over it.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_But, she left for manehattan years ago.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_But, we aren't friends.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_But.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Bye y'all!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Can you give us a minute rarity?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Can you handle the mission?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Can't handle the least bit of sentiment.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Catch!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Cause it looks like I'm gonna need it right about now.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Cause you already have a bunch of those that look exactly the same sitting in the drawer doing nothing.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Cherrywinks, cherry Cheesecake, cherry tarts, we Struck up a conversation being Orchard folk and all.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Chips. got it.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Come on apple bloom, Focus!

Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Come on, now. you're his sister.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Come on, ponies! kick 'em up, kick 'em out. Buck 'em up, buck 'em down.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Congratulations to y'all.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Could be the reason the map called me here!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Could be worse, I guess.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Could be wrong, but i think they might have noticed.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Course she is, sugarcube.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Dear diary, i'm glad granny smith's legend wasn't true.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Definitely not.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Do either of you even know what you're fighting over?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Do you have any idea How much business i could drum up for sweet apple acres?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Don't know what i would've done without ya.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Don't mean we can't dig them out.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Don't worry granny.

Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Guess we're just gonna have to start going down them One by one.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_He needs his rest so we can give him as a gift To my relatives in appaloosa.

Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I don't know. but i'm starting to think we should find out.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I don't think these bats are the ones that sucked my apples dry.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I figured looking for a friendship problem In las pegasus would be like trying to find a needle In a stack of needles.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I got my bedroll, parka, Unattractive but functional hikin' boots.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I got some fine apple juice waitin' for you.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I guess a pony who's here for a official princess business, Has to expect a little fussin'.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I guess.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I have to admit you're not the type of pony I expected to find in las pegasus.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I haven't danced that much since, Well, since your last party.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I hope you learned something too.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I knew right then just who i was supposed to be.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I know how you brides can be.

Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I need your help.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I said i'm sorry!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I should have listened to you when you noticed where this here branch would end up.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I swear i don't know why he is paying so much attention to me.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I think i have just the pony for you, starlight.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I think she was talkin' about the midsummer theatre revival?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I thought cherries would be a Nice change from apples so, i Took the job and came here. That's it end of story.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I thought you two got along.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I want to check in with apple bloom and find out How the sisterhooves social turned out.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I will if she will.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I wonder where everypony's headed.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'd say she's handling things pretty well. considering.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'd sure like to head back to ponyville on the next train.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'd take cover if i were you.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'll be chartin' a course to the very heart Of that maelstrom.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'll let you be. Looks like your friends want to talk to you.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'll never get used to that.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm a comin'.

Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm glad you're feelin' a little better, rainbow dash.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm here now and i'm not leavin' you home alone ever again.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm not so sure that tonic really does anything.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm not sure what we're supposed to do.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm pretty sure rarity is going to read a review Of her new boutique in manehattan.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm right here, little sis.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm sorry, pinkie, but i Can't tell y'all the truth.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm stickin' right by your side, always!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm suggestin' we stop worryin' about what we can't do.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm sure there are, but you don't need to.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm telling you rainbow, you got to melt that snow, now.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_I've been thinkin' the same thing.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_If anypony can stop cozy glow, it's her.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_If i had an apple stand set up.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_If it doesn't have a head, then how in tarnation Does this pony know where it's going?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_If it's supposed to be the most fashionable block of shops, Where's stinky bottom's discount hat emporium?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_If twilight trusts the map then so do i.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_If we go left, we'll be headin straight into the bite acuda fish!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_If y'all just be patient, we'll Have plenty more tomorrow.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_If you say so.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_If you're gonna be good, you're gonna be better with some of my apple brown bettys in ya.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_If'n you got the goods to trade for it.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Is inside a tree really the best place to be in a lightning storm?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Is that all you've got? yar hahah har!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Is very upsetting for a tree.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_It might lead to the way out.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_It must've been troubleshoes!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_It must've felt pretty nice to finally put All your connivin' and cheatin' skills to good use.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_It still takes every last pony in equestria, doin' their part.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_It was a plum puckered, pig pushin' disaster!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_It's a re-enactment of the founding of equestria.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_It's just one big party.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_It's kinda, well, my thing.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_It's not a story i'm proud of.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_It's not like it's the harvest day parade.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_It's what the apple family calls harvestin' time.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Just don't feel right to have you er, doing things for me.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Just had a couple minor hiccups along the way.

Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Map callin' me to a big city like manehattan?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Maybe it's just your new house and there ain't nothin' more to it than that.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Maybe it's right down there.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Maybe someponies don't care about that.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Maybe us telling them how much everypony was counting on them Messed them up somehow.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Maybe you don't need me frettin' over you all the time.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Me too.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Mister stripes, i owe your daughter an apology.

Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Ooh-whee! it's colder than A timberwolf's toenail!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oops. i guess i'm too plum tuckered out to do this right.

Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Other side, Winona.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Our granny took some tonic and we wanna know how it works.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Pickin' up all those little things.

Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Scoot your boot, apple bloom.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_See? that wasn't so bad!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Seems a hair odd though, don't it?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Seems like you might wanna take your time With each of these.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_She came out to the farm to get away from all her problems back home.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_She definitely tried her hardest.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_She tends to get a little wild if she doesn't get her exercise.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_She's gonna meet us up at our first campsite.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_She's not mean, twilight, she's a hoot!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_She's the one who got a job makin' costumes For that designer friend o' yours.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Shouldn't somepony do something?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Shouldn't you be working on the festival instead of coming up with new ways to impress trend?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Slumber one oh one, everything you.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_So busy, you forget to get a little somethin' in your belly.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_So i thought we'd give you a quick demonstration.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_So let's save it already.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_So much for that whole spell theory.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_So that should settle it once and for all which of us is the better friend.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_So the ponies decided to work together.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_So uh, I'm on my own.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_So we can get celestia and luna back, and keep the rest of equestria from becoming plant food.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_So, all you have to do Is make a different, stunning, original, amazing outfit.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_So, this here is winona.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Somepony who's avoidin' somethin', that's who. Soon as she wakes up, we're gonna find out what.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Somepony's in an awful quick hurry to get us outta here.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Sorry Twilight. These crystal ponies seem to have some kind of collective amnesia or something.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Sorry granny, i gotta check my traps Or the great seedling might get away!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Sounds to me like neither of you said those things.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Stroooke, stroooke, stroooke, slower!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Sugar it's okay. it's not necessary.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Sure you can twilight, and none of us begrudge you for it.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Take her nice and slow.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Tank, Opal And angel.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Thank you kindly for your hospitality.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Thanks again for the invite.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Thanks again for the wagon, Goldie.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Thanks, fluttershy.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Thanks, twilight.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_That in turn did in fact resemble a snake.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_That is mighty generous of you, but I think you've done enough for one day.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_That is, if we ever get off this street corner.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_That looks like a yes.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_That sassy totally stepped on your hooves, rarity.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_That should feel pretty good.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_That was rhetorical.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_That's it! gotta keep this assembly line moving gals.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_That's owlowiscious.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_That's right! let's go, bunnies!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_That's right.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_That's when this here appeared.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_The fastest cart now has gotta be slick and modern.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_The fruit bats do.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_The more she played, the bigger those shows got.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_The only pony who benefits from all this feudin' is gladmane, But by all accounts he's the best friend Any of these ponies have.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_The perimeter's clear.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Then you'll jump these big wooden hurdles.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Then you'll run around these trees fifty times Until you're real good and dizzy.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Then, we'll hang our hearth's warmin' dolls over the fireplace.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_There'll be plenty of time for family bonding While you're racing against your other cousins.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_There's a lot of ground to clear, you hear.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_There's no olden pony in our tent.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_These here vines are just the thing, rainbow dash!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_These ponies do look pretty darn excited.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_These things happen when these things are supposed to happen.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_They can take our farm, but they can't take our freedom.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_They must have every pony in the empire out sprucing it up!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_They're here!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Think maybe you're being just a tiny bit possessive of your brother?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Think we're ready to get this fair up and running.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_This be the only way to plunder cove.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_This doesn't sound like you.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_This here was the result.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_This is perfect. Now you don't have to worry about catching the blight.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_This midsummer theatre revival.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_This'll cure everything that ails you.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Though if it's a genuine cure, I don't suppose they'll be too keen on sharing the recipe.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_To remember the shared values of our ancestors.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_To remind us of the warmth shared on that fateful night.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Too bad ponyville doesn't have any ice archers competin'.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Triumphant, they raised a new flag.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Trust me little sis.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Twi? you okay? uh, twi?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Twilight! wait for us!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Twilight's probably as worried as everypony else and tryin' to find somewhere safe.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Two friendship problems, in the same theater? now we're talking!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Uh huh.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Uh, 'scuse me, i was wonderin'.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Uh, apple bloom? did you pack up the juice into the same crates As the zap apple jam?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Uh, friendship problem anypony?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Uh, hey rara, you mind if i talk to you about your manager?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Uh, it's okay. tank'll come back in a few months.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Uh, what happened to the flag?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Unlike your sparkly window doohickeys which are.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Up and at 'em Granny smith, we got guests.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_We can't even start the planting and the watering until we git all these heap a' snow hightailed outta here.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_We don't have anyone to root for.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_We gather all the apples from the trees so we can sell them.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_We got to do something!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_We got to forget those guys if we're gonna have a chance of winning.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_We gotta round up these beasts with wings first.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_We never would have been able to trick the trickster.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_We'll each patrol our own row of the orchard.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_We'll see if that svengallop truly Has your best interests at heart.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_We're gonna start off with an obstacle course for the young 'uns.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_We're just going to the train station.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well all righty then.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well i brought a treasure map to give 'em a rip roaring, Seafaring adventure.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well i know a thing or two about buildin' and fixin' things.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well if you're still interested after the festival I can teach you all about it.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well this sounds mighty easy.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, I never turn down a hard worker, but.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, a mobile is real nice.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, i don't hate you guys, either.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, i don't know about that, but.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, i hate to get in the way of you doing something you need to.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, i hope you can relate to ponyville.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, i took my half of our stash, and got you this.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, i'll be.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, i'm off to take a gander at some of the vintage stalls.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, i-i don't know, twilight.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, it looks like you'll have plenty of time to try to think about it.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, it would help if the harness was on right.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, like it or not, we're food too.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, looks like we're all set, now.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, that's the last of it filthy rich.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, there's a lot to do.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, they don't call him the super duper party planner for nothin'.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, wallop my withers spike, Isn't that just like a boy?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, what do we do now?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_What are you? sick or something?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_What do you say, fluttershy?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_What is it, exactly?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_What's gonna come of this here mission we're on?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_What's this thing for?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_When it comes to parties, I think she knows what she's doin'.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_When those fell through, we decided to simplify.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Where are you, spike?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Where did you learn to fly that fast?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Where you'll balance plates on your head while saying, pappy pony picked a pluck of pickly pluffnuggets, Over and over and over again.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Who will take the title this year? will it be somepony new?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Whoa ponies! wait for me!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Whoa!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Whoa, nellie.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Whoa, nelly.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Why don't you try bobbing for apples?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Why the long face sugarcube?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Why use a branch, when you could use a vine!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Why'd you believe gladmane when he said you did?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Why, we always round up our critters for a regular ol' pony pet playdate in this park.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Winona, put 'em up.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Without me, they'd be doin' all kinds of crazy fashiony things!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Wow girls we did a great job together.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Y'all did a mighty impressive job for your first go round.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Yeah, I'm sure.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Yeah, it wasn't even catchy.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Yeah, no.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Yeah, well.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Yeah. you sure did come on the right day.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Years of apple bucking.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Yep.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Yep. we wanted to make sure you two knew That all of ponyville was behind you.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_You all hear that?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_You are now! because i'm here and i'm stayin'!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_You can help granny smith and me bake some.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_You do?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_You got nothing to worry about, sugar cube.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_You know after all the heartache she's been having in manehattan.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_You know hearth's warmin' ain't just about Candy and presents right?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_You know how much tlc goes into getting an apple to grow like this?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_You sure you don't mind us all coming over?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_You two get the idea?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_You'll care plenty when they bite ya!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_You'll still be able to get some good playtime With winona like you said though, won't you?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_You're more nervous than a worm in an apple on cider-makin' day.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Your annoyin' attention to detail would have saved us from this whole mess.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Yup, i sure am glad miss cheerilee agreed To run the race over again.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_Zecora!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_all right, y'all!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_all right, y'all. here goes nothin'!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_and that once you did, You wouldn't be able to resist gloating about it.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_and the village was protected by an elite group of guard ponies, called the mighty helm.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_and try as they might, the mighty helm couldn't figure out a way to save the village.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_and while ponies wait, they get cold.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_and why there's a giant turtle eatin' my family's entire summer crop?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_as much as it is about being able to get through the rough patches together.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_basically, losing steam makes you use more towels.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_because ponyville day spa prides itself on cleanliness.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_but he was told that he was too scrawny and weak to protect the village.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_but i can't for the life of me think of how.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_but i still can't figure why you need so many.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_but i took one good look at that spa jam, and i knew i had to do something.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_but rainbow dash has been On a pranking tear and you can never be too careful.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_but the lava was getting closer.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_but then, i realized putting a little fright into 'em got them all hustlin' out of the pen.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_but uh, maybe i should go over it with you just to.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_cold ponies start wrapping themselves in towels, and all those dirty towels have to be cleaned.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_dear princess Celestia.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_dear princess celestia.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_don't let them fly away.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_forget her, ladies. focus!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_fraid so!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_getting the food bucket to spill into the trough was just a happy accident, because one time i left it there by mistake.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_guess not.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_having fun?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_he continued to work, knowing the odds were against him, but determined to push through.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_he might be able to save his village!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_he thought, if he could divert the flow of the lava.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_head them up and move them out!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_here's all those apples you wanted, fluttershy.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_hmmm.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_hold on, girls! we're almost there!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_i guess a list can't really capture all the ways i have of doin' things.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_i know that one's a crowd favorite. What's say we play it one more time?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_i mean, i guess it's possible to get stuck in a routine where you're doing all this extra stuff and not realizing.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_i mean, thinking you can is just plum ridiculous, right?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_i think i figured out the problem.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_i think you three should be real proud.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_i'll herd the little critters straight at you like a funnel.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_i'll rassle them up but I'll need everypony's help to do it.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_i'm gonna need my tools.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_i'm sorry, but i just couldn't let those spa ponies go another minute putting up with problems they didn't even know they had.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_i'm strong twilight but, not even i Can buck through solid rock.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_it's a tad easier to Be proud when you've come in First than it is when you finish further back.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_it's funny when you realize the extra work they were doing, was actually making things worse.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_it's just not necessary.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_keep a lid on them, rainbow dash!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_last i heard she went To help with the cause like everypony else.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_let's get a move on. we got a ton to see and barely any time to see it.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_let's see what the rest of you can do.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_look out, rarity! that one's fixin' to get away!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_move over y'all!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_of course not. i fixed that ages ago.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_oh, wait.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_rainbow dash, you and fluttershy stay on top of them.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_rainbow dash.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_really, you don't.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_rockhoof more than earned his place in the mighty helm.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_see this gate here used to squeak so loud the pigs would run to the other side of the pen and never come out.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_serious and play hard and.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_so every pony here wants a steam bath?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_so i open and close it to let them know it's safe.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_so rockhoof, decided to do something crazy.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_somehow they just got used to a huge bottleneck of ponies standin' around waitin'.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_sometimes the simplest things can just derail a whole operation.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_sorry 'bout that.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_that means you do more laundry which uses up the hot water you need to make more steam so the problem just keeps getting worse.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_that's all right twilight, i know you did your best.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_the truth is, the baby's an alicorn and her magic's plum crazy so.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_the volcano erupted!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_then, something magical happened.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_think you can come up with enough things for us to do now that we have more time to relax?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_through his extraordinary determination, and sheer force of will.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_time to power pony up!
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_twilight, you and rarity wait over there.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_uh. now who can we get to clean up all this garbage?
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_unfortunately, they seemed less interested in a treasure hunting adventure, and more interested in snacks.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_we aren't goin' to the past to learn about the holiday.
Applejack_Neutral_Very Noisy_we're almost there, youngins!

Applejack_Neutral__I try to tone it down a little bit around non family members.
Applejack_Neutral__I wanted to earn some money.
Applejack_Neutral__I was actin' a bit stubborn.
Applejack_Neutral__I was busy applebuckin', and I guess I, I closed my eyes for a second, and when I woke up, i was late.
Applejack_Neutral__I was gonna lend her a hoof but, maybe you could lend her one instead.
Applejack_Neutral__I was thinking more like, campfire stories.
Applejack_Neutral__I wasn't feelin' quite myself this mornin'.
Applejack_Neutral__I will tell you the whole truth, At, breakfast. Pinkie promise.

Applejack_Neutral__I'm happy to offer my extra hooves to ya.
Applejack_Neutral__I'm not sayin' anything!
Applejack_Neutral__I'm not so sure.
Applejack_Neutral__I'm okay!
Applejack_Neutral__I'm on it, i know just the thing.
Applejack_Neutral__I'm sorry pinkie, but i Can't tell y'all the truth.
Applejack_Neutral__I'm sorry, but that's my honest opinion.
Applejack_Neutral__I'm sure granny smith or big mac is behind this.
Applejack_Neutral__I'm sure they'll understand where you're comin' from.
Applejack_Neutral__I'm trying not to think about it.
Applejack_Neutral__I, guess i did get a little carried away watching over you.
Applejack_Neutral__I, i have an idea.
Applejack_Neutral__I, thought it'd be a good idea to give him a few barrels of juice To sell at the store before the season starts.
Applejack_Neutral__I-i gotta go with Big Mac so we can go over our packin' list or.
Applejack_Neutral__I-i guess I thought if I made it seem like everything was okay.
Applejack_Neutral__I-i think they're tryin' to say somethin'.
Applejack_Neutral__I-i was just as surprised as you are.
Applejack_Neutral__If it were up to me, we'd have a spoon clothes store Right next to stinky bottom's discount hat emporium.
Applejack_Neutral__If one of 'em overdoes it.
Applejack_Neutral__If only somepony hadn't been so persnickety.
Applejack_Neutral__If you say so.
Applejack_Neutral__Is a hearth's warmin' doll?
Applejack_Neutral__Is it too late to go back to small town chic?
Applejack_Neutral__Is it, bigger than a barn?
Applejack_Neutral__Is it.
Applejack_Neutral__Is it?
Applejack_Neutral__Is there some reason why?
Applejack_Neutral__It could be anything.
Applejack_Neutral__It don't work like that.
Applejack_Neutral__It is, it is, I'd just hate for us to get all excited before we found out for sure.
Applejack_Neutral__It might even do her some good.
Applejack_Neutral__It probably wouldn't be as special.
Applejack_Neutral__It seems to work for granny.
Applejack_Neutral__It usually is.
Applejack_Neutral__It won't be anythin' big or fancy but, it'll be somethin'.
Applejack_Neutral__It won't be the same without 'em.
Applejack_Neutral__It'll be fun, you'll see!

Applejack_Neutral__She don't need somepony like me babyin' her.
Applejack_Neutral__She got everypony together, and came up with a way To turn the tables on you.
Applejack_Neutral__She just started playing, she's bound to get better.
Applejack_Neutral__She looked in the barn, but it wasn't there.
Applejack_Neutral__She looked in the kitchen, but it wasn't there.
Applejack_Neutral__She was just a pony, standing in front of another pony, Asking him to love her.
Applejack_Neutral__She was tooting her own horn louder than the brass section of a marching band.
Applejack_Neutral__She'll know how to set things right.
Applejack_Neutral__She's an expert in animal enclosures.
Applejack_Neutral__Shoot spike, that's what friends do for each other.
Applejack_Neutral__Shoot, I was just gonna wear my old work duds.
Applejack_Neutral__Since that'd be something new and different for y'all.
Applejack_Neutral__Since you're offering and all.
Applejack_Neutral__So get in there with Twilight and show her what you're made of.
Applejack_Neutral__So helpin' her out is a ok by me.
Applejack_Neutral__So here's what i'm thinking.
Applejack_Neutral__So me and my family would be honored If you rested here in the barn during your visit.
Applejack_Neutral__So they don't get too carried away.
Applejack_Neutral__So uh, What are your names?
Applejack_Neutral__So uh, when are you gonna do her mane?
Applejack_Neutral__So when you say you haven't made a difference, that's just not true.
Applejack_Neutral__So which is the vintage one?
Applejack_Neutral__So why doesn't everypony take one of their own decorations out.
Applejack_Neutral__So you don't have to worry about that at all.
Applejack_Neutral__So you don't mind missing your only chance to ride the wild blue yonder.
Applejack_Neutral__So you started off on the wrong hoof.
Applejack_Neutral__So, it seems only fitting, to use My winnings, to fix up town hall.
Applejack_Neutral__So, it seems only fitting, to use My winnings, to fix up town hall.
Applejack_Neutral__So, that's a maybe?

Applejack_Neutral__That's mighty impressive.
Applejack_Neutral__That's right.
Applejack_Neutral__That's the only reason i agreed to let applebloom stay behind alone.
Applejack_Neutral__That's why I was sure she'd be waitin' for us in Ponyville.
Applejack_Neutral__That's why i came here.
Applejack_Neutral__That's, definitely unexpected.
Applejack_Neutral__The cider business in ponyville.
Applejack_Neutral__The competition's almost over.

Cadance_Neutral_Noisy_Once i had flurry heart, the line was easier for me to see.
Cadance_Neutral_Noisy_One of these days, we need to get together when the fate of equestria isn't hanging in the balance.
Cadance_Neutral_Noisy_Plus, it gives me an opportunity to see my favourite sister in law.
Cadance_Neutral_Noisy_Princess cadance is fine.
Cadance_Neutral_Noisy_She'll certainly be expecting my look to reflect the importance of her visit.
Cadance_Neutral_Noisy_Since i know that isn't a problem for you, Would you mind taking her below?
Cadance_Neutral_Noisy_Spending the day at the starswirl the bearded exhibit would have been more relaxing.
Cadance_Neutral_Noisy_That's what i said, isn't that what i said?
Cadance_Neutral_Noisy_The games inspector is known for doing her homework.
Cadance_Neutral_Noisy_The way you two worked together, it's like you've known each Other as long as twilight and i have.

Cadance_Neutral_Noisy_What was it that you needed?
Cadance_Neutral_Noisy_When meeting with important guests, It was tradition for rulers of the crystal empire To weave crystals into their manes in a very specific way.

Cadance_Neutral_Noisy_You could start with them.
Cadance_Neutral_Noisy_You said you had a second bit of news?
Cadance_Neutral_Noisy_You two have a real chemistry.
Cadance_Neutral_Noisy_You were right, twilight. they were breathtaking.
Cadance_Neutral_Noisy_You will always have obligations as a princess, But you also have an obligation to yourself.
Cadance_Neutral_Noisy_You'd be the very first dragon in the history of the equestria games to do so.
Cadance_Neutral_Noisy_You're already a good princess, twilight.
Cadance_Neutral_Noisy_You're not enjoying speaking for twilight a little bit?
Cadance_Neutral_Noisy_Your highness.

Celestia_Anxious_Noisy_What if she runs into a manticore?
Celestia_Anxious_Noisy_When the sun sets on the third day, The magic in our world will be gone.

Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_And your actions led to your being able to bring the real princess cadance, back to us.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_And your ponyville friends will join you there as well.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Because i believe you are the ponies who can help him do just that.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Before my sister and i stood up to him, He ruled equestria in an eternal state of unrest, and unhappiness.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_But her work there would be very rewarding.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_But i do know that it is a mystery you will not be solving alone.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_But i kept inventing all kinds of reasons Why i shouldn't send you.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_But i noticed that her pursuit of academia Was preventing her from reaching her full potential.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_But i wonder if the answers can be found somewhere Within the pages of this book.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_But if you look carefully, you may find a Book that could prove helpful to your research.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_But it means a lot that you tried.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_But today, twilight sparkle did something extraordinary.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_But twilight.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_But what is the princess of friendship, without her friends?
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Did you learn anything About friendship from this experience?
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Do you know now?
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Do you understand?
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Don't worry about me. i'm fine.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Even befriending a young unicorn wizard.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Even without these elements, the tree of harmony will possess a powerful magic.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Eventually, i realized all the anxiety i felt, Was because i didn't want you to go.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Everypony's asleep.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_For even i don't know the answer.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Good morning sister!
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Have no fear, ponies. I have total confidence That you will be able to defeat discord, with these.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_He has just now gained enough strength to use his dark powers.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_He is.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Hereby decree, that the unicorn twilight sparkle.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Hidden somewhere in what's left of the castle library.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_I am embarrassed to admit it but, i was afraid If you made friends.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_I believe it is yours, princess twilight.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_I believe she may know best how to begin reforming discord.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_I believe that one means your mission is complete.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_I commend him for taking your feelings seriously.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_I do not know where they are.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_I don't think i've ever come across A unicorn with your raw abilities.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_I had a decision to make.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_I have every confidence you will succeed.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_I have them right here.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_I knew there was a special group of fillies in ponyville.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_I know how to handle nightmare moon.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_I must say, it's very nice having you take over some of the planning responsibilities for this year's gala.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_I really enjoy doing it.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_I seem to recall something about earth ponies, Unicorns and pegasi doing something similar, don't you?
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_I was constantly surprised and impressed With her discoveries.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_I'll know you are ready to move on to the next level of your studies.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_I'll leave the elements of harmony with you, twilight.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_I'll leave you to get settled.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_I'll leave you to it.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_I'll say a few words, and then we'll begin with the vows.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_I'm afraid i must call in another to stop tirek.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_I'm afraid i must call in another to stop tirek.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_I'm sure princess twilight sparkle has a good explanation For all of this.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_I've called you here for a matter of great importance.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_I, princess celestia.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_If anyone knows how to run a School, it's you.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_In the end, it must be you and you alone.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Intent on stealing equestrian magic.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Isn't that right, philomena?
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_It appears so.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_It has been a thousand years Since i have seen you like this.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_It is no longer with a heavy heart.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_It is only by making this sacrifice, That equestria and the lands beyond it might be saved.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_It must be you, and you alone.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_It seems an old foe of mine, Someone i thought i had defeated long ago, has returned. His name, is discord.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_It was just what we needed.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_It was the right call, going with your gut.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_It's a small way to say, i care.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_It's a wonderful feeling, isn't it?
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Join us?
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Learning to trust your instincts is a valuable lesson to learn.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Let me tell you a story.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Looks like you all learned a pretty valuable lesson today.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_May we have the rings, please?
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Moon raised.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_My most faithful student.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_My olde ponish is a bit rusty.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Need i remind you that you are the ponies Who turned him back into stone like this in the first place?
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Not even a princess can do whatever she likes When it comes to shaping young pony minds.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Nothing means more to me Than the well being of all my subjects.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Now where is fluttershy?
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Now, if you will all excuse me, i must return to canterlot.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Of course not, my little pony.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Of course not, you've never run a school before.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Of course, starlight.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Of course.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, hello starlight.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, twilight, i'm not.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Once upon a time, there was a very bright young filly.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Only you can make that decision.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Over the years, we've watched you grow.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Perhaps but, she is like this every morning.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Shall take on a new mission for equestria.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_She created new magic, proving without a doubt that she is ready to be crowned equestria's newest princess.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_She defeated her younger sister.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_She must continue to study the magic of friendship.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_She must report to me her findings.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_She vowed that she would shroud The land in eternal night.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_She was truly one of my best students.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_She'd have to talk to the other fillies then.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Shining armor, you'll get the ring from your best mare.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Since you've come to ponyville, you've displayed the charity, compassion, devotion, integrity.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_So we'll have plenty of time together.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_So you have an overachieving student? sounds familiar.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_So, twilight sparkle.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Spike, take a note, please.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Starlight would be busy for a very long time.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Students going hungry? not on our watch!
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Tell me what's wrong.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Thank you again.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Thank you all.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_The changelings have so much to learn About how to enjoy love through friendships.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_The e e a ensures that whether it's unicorns studying magic, Pegasi learning weather, Or earth ponies researching agriculture.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_The mayor has requested an audience with me.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Then of course, cadance will enter.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Then we haven't much time.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_There's usually some crisis we have to deal with.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_They'll need to approve your plan Before you can move forward.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_This crystalling might be more important than ever.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_This is a momentous decision.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_This is quite a discovery, sunburst.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_This is your victory as much as theirs.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Time to put our differences behind us.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Took the occasion to have a little fun with you fluttershy.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Trust me, little sister.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Twilight, as i understand it, spike brought princess cadence the crystal heart.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Uh, this is twilight's fantasy, spike.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Uh, yes spike.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Using the magic of the elements of harmony.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Very well. i'll forget twilight's punishment on one condition.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Watching your student shine The way you always knew they could.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_We are living proof that letting someone Spread their wings, doesn't mean you no longer have a place in their lives.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_We will do this.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_We will search for ways to protect equestria in your absence.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Welcome to the grand galloping gala.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Well there's nothing wrong here, Right sister?
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Well, i want you right by my side the entire evening.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_When, and only when, you happen to discover them.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Where on earth would you get such an idea?
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Which aren't real so it shouldn't be too hard, right?
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Which is why i.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_While it appears healthy and happy most of the time.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Who ultimately assists Princess Cadance, and Shining Armor in doing what needs to be done to protect the empire.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Why so glum, my faithful student?
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Yes, i understand.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Yes, spike.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_You are an inspiration to us all, twilight.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_You have proven that you're ready twilight.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_You may release discord when ready.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_You might find you need help.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_You must consider all the possibilities.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_You persisted in the face of doubt.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_You've been wondering what you are meant to do as a princess.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_You, and your friends.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_Your friend spike made me aware that you were letting your fears get the best of you.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_a rampaging beast? evil spell? friendship problem?
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_about one thing. a good leader knows when to ask for help.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_and here are instructions of how to prepare for the royal swanifying.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_and the strength to make it right.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_as you know, the ancient castle that i once Shared with princess luna lies mostly in ruins, Deep in the everfree forest.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_dear twilight sparkle.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_everything you've gone through over the years has been a training program.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_exactly what i was thinking.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_girls, thank you so much for coming.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_i am sorry twilight, but it looks as though Shining armor has truly won the crown.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_i do know.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_i have a few things for us too.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_i see you've made yourselves at home.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_i thought climbing mount fillymanejaro was on my list.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_i understand. but for me every day is real world.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_i will represent their authority.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_it is indeed.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_luna and i have decided it may have been a bit unfair to thrust this upon you.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_no need to thank us.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_no need, spike.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_not exactly. battling the everfree forest alongside starswirl made us realize what we've missed out on.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_oh of course you are. i realize this is a lot to take in but.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_oh. well. since we're going the same way.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_optimism, and of course, the leadership, Of a true princess.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_so i asked our old captain of the guard to handle the job.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_so lovely to see you again, as well as your friends.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_so, after much consideration, my sister and i have decided, it is time for us, to retire.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_the night's pretty special too.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_throughout our city, ponies have been reporting tales of their magic failing.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_we have put a small part of our power in this amulet.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_well they hurt less than that horrible howling you dragged us to.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_with the return of sombra, princess luna and i felt it was time to reinforce the castle's defenses.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_without giving you the time you need to prepare.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_you can activate it with your magic at any time.
Celestia_Neutral_Noisy_you didn't need a stamp if you were just going to give this to me.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_A curse that caused it to vanish into thin air.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_A letter from ponyville, i presume?
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_A phoenix is a majestic and magical bird.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_All just a normal part of the life cycle of a phoenix.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_And i've cast a spell so discord can't take them and hide them again.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_And realize how special you are.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_And so without further ado.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_And tirek was sent to tartarus for his crimes.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_As long as that magic remains, It will continue to control and contain all that grows here.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_As long as that magic remains, it will continue to control and contain all that grows here.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_At tonight's welcome reception, princess cadance will dedicate This beautiful friendship statue, made up of gemstones From each of your home cities.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_Because he did not understand friendship like you do.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_Both of which my sister and I feel confident.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_But not before he was able to put a curse upon the empire.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_But what i do know, is that it contains a powerful magic.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_Citizens of Equestria and beyond!
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_Citizens of equestria.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_Discord is the mischievous spirit of disharmony.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_Enjoy your stay.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_Even my knowledge of the empire is limited.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_Even without these elements, the tree of harmony will possess a powerful magic.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_Fall is one of my favorite seasons, so i came to celebrate the running of the leaves.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_Few remember it ever existed at all.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_From all the unique places that make up our wonderful land of equestria.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_However, for the moment, perhaps it is best That we leave the changeling kingdom, to the changelings.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_I am very impressed, princess.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_I care.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_I care.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_I kept you in canterlot longer than i should have.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm afraid i put too much trust in discord, And the effect that friendship would have upon him.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm fully aware that the last time discord was here, He created serious havoc.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_If hatred and fear take hold.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_If hatred and fear take hold.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_If the empire is filled with hope and love.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_Indeed, you do.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_It is, as i said, a different kind of test.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_King sombra, a unicorn whose heart was black as night.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_No, that's quite all right. i think i can remember.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_No, twilight.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_Now i'd like to turn things over to the one who organized the summit.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_Now, i must return to canterlot for equestria's royal summit.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_One thousand years ago.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_Perfect, girls. no need to rush.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_Scorpan returned to his own land.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_Something even a great unicorn like star swirl the bearded, was not able to do.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_Spells going wrong, potions not working.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_The crystal empire has returned.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_Then it is unlikely you are meant to take on this task alone.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_There is no doubt that tirek is after alicorn magic.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_There is no doubt that tirek is after alicorn magic.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_There is word he has gone after earth ponies as well.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_There will be no rain in equestria.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_There wouldn't be.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_This is a different kind of test.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_Thorax, as the new leader of the changelings, i look forward to discussing how we can improve our relationship in the future.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_Those things are reflected across all of equestria.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_Tirek has stolen enough magic That he now has the strength to steal flight as well.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_Took over the crystal empire.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_We are gathered here today to witness the union of Princess mi amore cadenza and shining armor.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_We have managed to discover the only means by which we can defeat discord, And free the citizens of equestria.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_We have the utmost confidence in you.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_We know how difficult it must've been for you to give up the elements.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_When I sent you to Ponyville, I had high hopes.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_With discord by his side, we will not be able to stop him from taking it.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_Without pegasi to control the weather.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_Without their strength, they will not be able to tend the land.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_You are now twilight sparkle, the princess of friendship.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_You delegates have traveled far and wide To represent your cities, as we seek to celebrate and learn.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_a swarm of incredibly bothersome creatures has invaded the poor town.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_actually we just need a few days to put together a little ceremony.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_an old student of mine believes he does.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_and banished to the ice of the arctic north.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_and we shall contain the forest.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_apparently there's been some sort of, infestation.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_before i have to go, would you care to give me your latest report on the magic of friendship in person?
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_but even we know that change eventually comes to us all.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_can actually be the thing That helps you make your closest friends.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_did somepony say, lost?
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_did you know, that nopony has ever explored the bottom of these caverns?
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_haven't you learned anything about friendship?
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_he was ultimately overthrown, turned to shadow.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_i wouldn't advise it, rainbow dash.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_i'm afraid an emergency has come up in fillydelphia.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_i'm sorry twilight to have to put you all through so much trouble.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_i'm terribly honored that you and the good citizens of ponyville, have organised a parade in honor of my visit.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_if the empire is filled with hope and love, those things are reflected across all of equestria.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_indeed.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_it sounds like you're all learning so much from each other.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_it's as natural as the rising and setting of the sun and the moon.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_perhaps.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_so instead of spending the day ruling.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_sounds to me Like an important lesson was learned.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_sunglasses, bug spray, ice boots, hoof sanitizer, and travel snacks!
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_unfortunately, that visit is going to have to wait for another time.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_we wanted a chance to do the things you do.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_what is this?
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_yes.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_you have a very special gift.
Celestia_Neutral_Very Noisy_you may be more of a wizard than you think.
Celestia_Neutral__Actually, there is.
Celestia_Neutral__Ahe heh hem.
Celestia_Neutral__All i ever wanted was to share an honest bond of creativity, Artistry, and happiness with my friends.
Celestia_Neutral__All right.
Celestia_Neutral__All the different types of ponies.
Celestia_Neutral__Although luna and i once wielded the elements, It is you who now control their power, and it is you who must defeat discord.
Celestia_Neutral__And created harmony for all the land.
Celestia_Neutral__And forges a special bond of friendship.
Celestia_Neutral__And i do appreciate That your heart was in the right place child.
Celestia_Neutral__And i knew it was you Who had the magic inside to defeat her.
Celestia_Neutral__And i'm sure you won't.
Celestia_Neutral__And thank you twilight. your help will reveal If there are any holes in our security.
Celestia_Neutral__And that's exactly what i got to do.
Celestia_Neutral__And though we know it can be unsettling.
Celestia_Neutral__And when she does, we'll know that she is that much closer to being ready.
Celestia_Neutral__And while we'll always be here if you need us, it's time for us to be on our way.
Celestia_Neutral__And you can return to your studies in canterlot?
Celestia_Neutral__And you did a wonderful job of it.
Celestia_Neutral__Anypony can get swept up in the excitement of competition.
Celestia_Neutral__Are you not happy that your quest is complete?
Celestia_Neutral__As do i. As princess, i care deeply About all creatures great and small.
Celestia_Neutral__Be very careful.
Celestia_Neutral__Before tirek has the chance to steal it from us.
Celestia_Neutral__Brought out the moon to begin the night.
Celestia_Neutral__But all you had to do was ask me, And i could have told you philomena was a phoenix, And saved you all this trouble.
Celestia_Neutral__But are you certain it's wise?
Celestia_Neutral__But as time went on.
Celestia_Neutral__But from now on, none of you will have to call me princess anymore.
Celestia_Neutral__But i have use for discord's magic If it can be reformed to serve good instead of evil.
Celestia_Neutral__But i hope you know i will always be here if you need me.
Celestia_Neutral__But i wouldn't ask if i weren't confident You could get him to use magic obediently of his own free will.
Celestia_Neutral__But it appears he has found a way to escape.
Celestia_Neutral__But nothing unusual for a phoenix.
Celestia_Neutral__But one i'm certain you will pass.
Celestia_Neutral__But scorpan soon came to appreciate the ways of equestria.
Celestia_Neutral__But shunned and slept through her beautiful night.
Celestia_Neutral__But still, it's something i always wished I could experience.
Celestia_Neutral__But the bitterness in the young one's heart.
Celestia_Neutral__But there is one solution.
Celestia_Neutral__But we're all your students now too.
Celestia_Neutral__But you could not unleash it Until you let true friendship into your heart.
Celestia_Neutral__But you know that the truth is always better than a well meant lie.
Celestia_Neutral__But you need to learn to tame these abilities Through focused study.
Celestia_Neutral__By joining princess Cadance and Shining Armor in the Crystal Empire.
Celestia_Neutral__Come on, starswirl!
Celestia_Neutral__Didn't applejack remind you?
Celestia_Neutral__Discord.
Celestia_Neutral__Do you still think you can take on this responsibility?
Celestia_Neutral__Dragons glow whenever the dragon lord Has need of them in the dragonlands.
Celestia_Neutral__Equestria needs you.
Celestia_Neutral__Even as it hurts.
Celestia_Neutral__Everything is fine, mister and missus cake.
Celestia_Neutral__Far better that i have a student who understands the meaning of self sacrifice.
Celestia_Neutral__Feel the rising sun's warmth.
Celestia_Neutral__Fluttershy will be our new lead.
Celestia_Neutral__Follow me.
Celestia_Neutral__Fortunately, i know a thing or two about how to deal with those.
Celestia_Neutral__Good luck, my little ponies.
Celestia_Neutral__Gotcha.
Celestia_Neutral__Having all four of us in the empire to greet them, Lets the dignitaries know that their visit is considered an important one.
Celestia_Neutral__Here we are after all these years, twilight.
Celestia_Neutral__His time in tartarus left him very weak.
Celestia_Neutral__Hm. a very valuable lesson to have learned.
Celestia_Neutral__Hm. i was not aware that i was an expression.
Celestia_Neutral__I am quite looking forward to just enjoying the gala for once.
Celestia_Neutral__I definitely sense a big change in discord.
Celestia_Neutral__I do.
Celestia_Neutral__I don't have to get a letter every week to know that.
Celestia_Neutral__I know it must have been difficult to see your friends return to ponyville without you.
Celestia_Neutral__I loved having you as a student.
Celestia_Neutral__I need you to wield the Elements of Harmony once again.
Celestia_Neutral__I need you to wield the elements of harmony once again, And stop discord, Before he thrusts all of equestria into eternal chaos.
Celestia_Neutral__I never felt i had to be on stage to be a part of the show.
Celestia_Neutral__I realize that this is a tall order.
Celestia_Neutral__I saw the signs of nightmare moon's return.
Celestia_Neutral__I think starlight glimmer might feel the same way About you.
Celestia_Neutral__I told you that you needed to make some friends.
Celestia_Neutral__I understand from twilight sparkle's letters That you enjoy tending to the needs of woodland creatures.
Celestia_Neutral__I was always too busy with my magic lessons to be part of any plays myself.
Celestia_Neutral__I'm afraid mischievous little philomena here.
Celestia_Neutral__I'm listening.
Celestia_Neutral__I'm sorry, princess twilight.
Celestia_Neutral__I'm still learning to hone my craft.
Celestia_Neutral__I'm sure you'll agree that in the end.
Celestia_Neutral__I've always believed, theatre brings out the best in us.
Celestia_Neutral__I've missed you, too.
Celestia_Neutral__I-i have no acting experience at all.
Celestia_Neutral__I-it's just.
Celestia_Neutral__If we transfer our magic to you, tirek will not know where it has gone.
Celestia_Neutral__If you need a moment, that's all right. It is your coronation.
Celestia_Neutral__If you, agree?
Celestia_Neutral__In light of the little one's abilities.
Celestia_Neutral__In the magical land.
Celestia_Neutral__Isn't there an old saying, the show must go on?
Celestia_Neutral__It appears her magic is more powerful Than that of a newborn unicorn.
Celestia_Neutral__It didn't turn out so bad for this group of friends.
Celestia_Neutral__It seems we need to make adjustments To account for threats inside, the castle as well as out.
Celestia_Neutral__It took great courage to relinquish them.
Celestia_Neutral__It's a difficult one, but your heart knows what's right.
Celestia_Neutral__It's beautiful.
Celestia_Neutral__It's been a joy getting to know you all better.
Celestia_Neutral__It's nothing, really.
Celestia_Neutral__Judging by how many flowers the audience threw.
Celestia_Neutral__Just as i hope you'll always be here when i need you.
Celestia_Neutral__Just in case.
Celestia_Neutral__Let them know the play will start in just a minute.
Celestia_Neutral__M-my apologies.
Celestia_Neutral__Mares and gentlecolts.
Celestia_Neutral__Mares and gentlecolts.
Celestia_Neutral__Maybe i could close the library Or, throw a party in the castle?
Celestia_Neutral__Maybe i'm not such a bad actress after all.
Celestia_Neutral__Mind?
Celestia_Neutral__My most faithful student, twilight sparkle, has done many extraordinary things since she's lived in ponyville.
Celestia_Neutral__My sister and I have ruled this land for quite some time.
Celestia_Neutral__Nightmare moon.
Celestia_Neutral__No longer in that role.
Celestia_Neutral__No need for that now, princess twilight.
Celestia_Neutral__No, but i am a princess.
Celestia_Neutral__No. i had so much fun tonight i've decided to give up my crown, step down from the throne.
Celestia_Neutral__Not in the same way as before. i'll still be here to help and guide you.
Celestia_Neutral__Nothing more.
Celestia_Neutral__Nothing.
Celestia_Neutral__Now if only another will as well.
Celestia_Neutral__Now, unfortunately, because the two of you were busy tricking each other instead of shaking down leaves, many of the lovely trees in equestria are still covered.
Celestia_Neutral__Of Equestria.
Celestia_Neutral__Oh, forgive me, for getting so excited.
Celestia_Neutral__Oh, it was so wonderful, everypony coming together.
Celestia_Neutral__Oh, maybe wait until after the coronation.
Celestia_Neutral__Oh, not me.
Celestia_Neutral__Oh, yes, yes my royal canterlot voice.
Celestia_Neutral__Oh. you had good intentions, twilight.
Celestia_Neutral__Once upon a time.
Celestia_Neutral__One fateful day.
Celestia_Neutral__Perhaps you should address your subjects, And remind them of that.
Celestia_Neutral__Princess Cadance and Shining Armor are already there.
Celestia_Neutral__Princess cadance and shining armor.
Celestia_Neutral__Princess luna.
Celestia_Neutral__Rainbow dash, bring us some clouds and place them behind the stage.
Celestia_Neutral__Rarity, applejack, pinkie pie, twilight, go calm the audience.
Celestia_Neutral__Ready, sister?
Celestia_Neutral__Regal, commanding, confident.
Celestia_Neutral__Royal duty calls.
Celestia_Neutral__She even helped reunite me with my sister, princess luna.
Celestia_Neutral__She is quite a sight, isn't she?
Celestia_Neutral__She will succeed at her task.
Celestia_Neutral__She's quite a sight, as i said.
Celestia_Neutral__Should i get you a blanket?
Celestia_Neutral__Since all of you recovered them.
Celestia_Neutral__So the map sent you to solve a friendship problem?
Celestia_Neutral__Somepony always needs our help. but today.
Celestia_Neutral__Spike, you narrate the play.
Celestia_Neutral__Starlight, do you have a copy of the script?
Celestia_Neutral__Than one who only looks out for her best interests.
Celestia_Neutral__Thank you for the reminder, twilight.
Celestia_Neutral__Thank you, twilight.
Celestia_Neutral__That special stage pony bond of shared trust and honesty.
Celestia_Neutral__That's all right applejack.
Celestia_Neutral__That's quite all right.
Celestia_Neutral__The crystal empire has returned.
Celestia_Neutral__The dragonlands are particularly dangerous For ponies. it would be wise to be discreet.
Celestia_Neutral__The e e a guidebook is very specific About how to run a school.
Celestia_Neutral__The elder sister took on responsibility.
Celestia_Neutral__The eldest.
Celestia_Neutral__The elements of harmony.
Celestia_Neutral__The equestria education association is a board Of learned ponies that oversee every school in equestria.
Celestia_Neutral__The lessons you've learned here in ponyville, have taught you well.
Celestia_Neutral__The others will be joining them soon.
Celestia_Neutral__The power of their love, undeniable.
Celestia_Neutral__The strength of their commitment is clear.
Celestia_Neutral__The stronger he becomes, the more we are all in danger.
Celestia_Neutral__The union of princess cadance and shining armor.
Celestia_Neutral__The younger sister became resentful.
Celestia_Neutral__The younger unicorn refused to lower the moon to make way for the dawn.
Celestia_Neutral__The younger.
Celestia_Neutral__Then go. there is no time to lose.
Celestia_Neutral__Then i hope you will return to canterlot on occasion, And share the wisdom of your great experience, With the next generation of ponies.
Celestia_Neutral__Then we must begin at once.
Celestia_Neutral__There is no wrong way to fantasize.
Celestia_Neutral__There may be a way for us to save the play yet.
Celestia_Neutral__There were two regal sisters who ruled together.
Celestia_Neutral__There. that's our new backdrop.
Celestia_Neutral__This is philomena.
Celestia_Neutral__This is why i've brought discord here.
Celestia_Neutral__This, is canterlot tower.
Celestia_Neutral__Throw off that musty hat, and let's have a a dance!
Celestia_Neutral__Thus, the two sisters maintained balance for their kingdom and their subjects.
Celestia_Neutral__Tirek and his brother scorpan came here from a distant land.
Celestia_Neutral__To create a magical experience to share with others.
Celestia_Neutral__To do this.
Celestia_Neutral__Twilight doesn't need anything else to worry about today.
Celestia_Neutral__Twilight sparkle.
Celestia_Neutral__Twilight, it doesn't matter if Discord set up your successes or not.
Celestia_Neutral__Used her unicorn powers to raise the sun at dawn.
Celestia_Neutral__Very well.
Celestia_Neutral__Visualize with me.
Celestia_Neutral__We are gathered here today in celebration of a momentous occasion.
Celestia_Neutral__We are gathered here today to celebrate the union of the real princess mi amore cadenza.
Celestia_Neutral__We believe in you and always have.
Celestia_Neutral__We do not believe that tirek is aware that a fourth alicorn princess exists in equestria.
Celestia_Neutral__We know Equestria is in the perfect hooves with you and your friends looking out for it.
Celestia_Neutral__We must rid ourselves of our magic, Before tirek has the chance to steal it from us.
Celestia_Neutral__We must rid ourselves of our magic.
Celestia_Neutral__We play charades.
Celestia_Neutral__We were meant to rule together, little sister.
Celestia_Neutral__Well, i don't know about that.
Celestia_Neutral__Well, it has been over a thousand years.
Celestia_Neutral__Well?
Celestia_Neutral__What did you have in mind?
Celestia_Neutral__What do you have planned?
Celestia_Neutral__What's next?
Celestia_Neutral__When i was a filly, my friends often put on plays.
Celestia_Neutral__Where the elements are kept inside.
Celestia_Neutral__Which is why i need your help finding a way to protect it.
Celestia_Neutral__Will you accept my friendship?
Celestia_Neutral__Will you stay here and teach magic once again?
Celestia_Neutral__Yes, me too, twi.
Celestia_Neutral__Yes.
Celestia_Neutral__Yes. but let's celebrate later.
Celestia_Neutral__Yes?
Celestia_Neutral__You are a wonderful student, twilight.
Celestia_Neutral__You challenged me and taught me just as much As i taught you.
Celestia_Neutral__You did something today that's never been done before.
Celestia_Neutral__You have a real wedding to put together.
Celestia_Neutral__You have to add water, what do you think?
Celestia_Neutral__You may no longer be my student, princess twilight.
Celestia_Neutral__You really mean that?
Celestia_Neutral__You shouldn't.
Celestia_Neutral__You six showed the full potential of the elements, By harnessing the magic of your friendship, to beat a mighty foe.
Celestia_Neutral__You want to give me acting lessons?
Celestia_Neutral__You weren't willing to risk the future of the citizens of the crystal empire, in an effort to guarantee your own.
Celestia_Neutral__You won't.
Celestia_Neutral__You won't.
Celestia_Neutral__You're a princess.
Celestia_Neutral__You're all more than capable.
Celestia_Neutral__You're not the only ones.
Celestia_Neutral__You're scaring everypony.
Celestia_Neutral__You're welcome, twilight.
Celestia_Neutral__You, are ready.
Celestia_Neutral__Your invitation is very kind.
Celestia_Neutral__and i wouldn't trade you for any of the adventures on my list.
Celestia_Neutral__and it's all thanks to you, twilight.
Celestia_Neutral__and stop Discord.
Celestia_Neutral__and your friends, of course.
Celestia_Neutral__because you weren't sure how quickly you could find a way to escape the tower.
Celestia_Neutral__but a great leader has the courage to admit.
Celestia_Neutral__i'm laughing because I had the exact same fears you're having.
Celestia_Neutral__if that is what you're afraid of.
Celestia_Neutral__it is time for a new day in equestria.
Celestia_Neutral__it is time for us, to retire.
Celestia_Neutral__it will, but when she's ready.
Celestia_Neutral__it's not always easy being the big sister, either.
Celestia_Neutral__meetings and decrees, and meetings about decrees, and decrees about the meetings.
Celestia_Neutral__now where have i seen that before?
Celestia_Neutral__only, it's much harder to justify a vacation from the castle when it's not an emergency we're responding to.
Celestia_Neutral__today you've proven to me beyond any doubt, that you will be a great leader.
Celestia_Neutral__well, if i must.
Celestia_Neutral__when they've made a mistake.
Celestia_Neutral__with the help of your friends, of course.
Celestia_Neutral__you think maybe twilight's having trouble with the amulet?
Celestia_Neutral__you wouldn't need me anymore.
Celestia_Neutral__you're right.
Celestia_Sad Annoyed_Noisy_i just remembered something i forgot i always wanted to do.
Celestia_Sad Annoyed__Because in all the time we've known each other.
Celestia_Sad Annoyed__I thought i'd taught you about the importance of friendship, Trust, and honesty.
Celestia_Sad Annoyed__I'm afraid i haven't much to say, twilight.
Celestia_Sad Annoyed__I'm not upset because you insulted my acting.
Celestia_Sad Annoyed__I'm upset.
Celestia_Sad Anxious_Noisy_I was wrong, your job is so incredibly hard.
Celestia_Sad Anxious_Noisy_It takes such a brave, strong pony to do what you do!
Celestia_Sad Anxious__If you honestly felt i was a bad actress, why didn't you tell me?
Celestia_Sad Anxious__Twilight.
Celestia_Sad Anxious__You have to battle nightmares and work in the darkness And do it all alone.
Celestia_Sad_Noisy_It was just a terrible reminder that i had to banish my own sister.
Celestia_Sad_Noisy_Oh dear sister.
Celestia_Sad_Noisy_be! alone!
Celestia_Sad_Noisy_but it wasn't easy.
Celestia_Sad_Noisy_i'm sorry, but you have given me no choice.
Celestia_Sad_Very Noisy_I'm sorry everypony, I'm afraid i have to cut the party short.
Celestia_Sad_Very Noisy_but to use, these!
Celestia_Sad__But for me.
Celestia_Sad__For my subjects, it has always been a celebration of my defeat of nightmare moon.
Celestia_Sad__I don't know how you do this alone.
Celestia_Sad__I must send her away.
Celestia_Sad__i'm sorry too.
Celestia_Sarcastic_Noisy_Oh, i apologize for not noticing flowers in a wall sconce.
Celestia_Sarcastic_Noisy_You spend your evenings, flitting around Giving ponies lovely dreams! Oh, it sounds just awful.
Celestia_Sarcastic__This is just wonderful!
Celestia_Shouting_Very Noisy_Twilight sparkle!
Celestia_Shouting_Very Noisy_halt, interloper!
Celestia_Shouting__It is time for a new day in equestria!
Celestia_Smug_Noisy_As for cozy glow i can assure you, Where she's going she won't be causing any more trouble.
Celestia_Smug_Noisy_But now that you have so foolishly revealed your true self.
Celestia_Smug_Noisy_But now, i get to sleep and tonight will be a breeze.
Celestia_Smug_Noisy_I don't know about you, but i feel very well rested.
Celestia_Smug_Noisy_My list was three times as long!
Celestia_Smug_Noisy_Oh but it's nothing i can't handle.
Celestia_Smug_Noisy_preferably dawn, and dusk.
Celestia_Smug_Very Noisy_the elements, of harmony!
Celestia_Smug__Did she now?
Celestia_Smug__I'm expecting some mail.
Celestia_Smug__It seems my duties were harder than my sister expected.
Celestia_Smug__Oh, that does seem fitting.
Celestia_Smug__You can try.
Celestia_Surprised Confused__w-what?
Celestia_Surprised Happy_Noisy_Oh!
Celestia_Surprised_Noisy_Oh! um, thank you.
Celestia_Surprised_Noisy_oh!

Celestia_Whispering_Noisy_Say something, princess.
Celestia_Whispering__It is time for a new day in equestria.
Celestia_Whispering__It is time for a new day in equestria.
Celestia_Whispering__Rather melodramatic, if you ask me.

Chancellor Neighsay_Annoyed__You again, as i suspected.
Chancellor Neighsay_Neutral_Noisy_Did you hear something?
Chancellor Neighsay_Neutral_Noisy_Everypony will come to their senses, eventually.
Chancellor Neighsay_Neutral_Noisy_I'd heard rumors you've returned.
Chancellor Neighsay_Neutral_Noisy_I, chancellor neighsay, hereby confer upon friendship University complete and unreserved e e a accreditation.
Chancellor Neighsay_Neutral_Noisy_Magic is failing across our land, And she left a foal in charge of this facility?
Chancellor Neighsay_Neutral_Noisy_Meantime this university appears to be a promising option For, ponies, who'd prefer to stick to the e e a book on the subject.
Chancellor Neighsay_Neutral_Noisy_One would think the headmare of a school of friendship, Albeit an unaccredited one, would behave differently.
Chancellor Neighsay_Neutral_Noisy_That won't be necessary.
Chancellor Neighsay_Neutral_Noisy_The equestria educational association has taken an Interest in institutions that teach friendship, In a pony first environment.
Chancellor Neighsay_Neutral_Noisy_There really isn't anything else i need to see.
Chancellor Neighsay_Neutral_Noisy_Why the e e a, of course.
Chancellor Neighsay_Neutral__Ah yes.
Chancellor Neighsay_Neutral__And if a pony of your stature is studying her.
Chancellor Neighsay_Neutral__But i didn't believe it until now.
Chancellor Neighsay_Neutral__But my word princess, i wonder if the, ill manners Of the creatures at your school aren't contagious.
Chancellor Neighsay_Neutral__I think i will take my leave before i become infected.
Chancellor Neighsay_Neutral__I understand feeling threatened by competition.
Chancellor Neighsay_Neutral__Surely you didn't think your school Has a monopoly on the concept?
Chancellor Neighsay_Neutral__Unless, she was trying to undermine the competition? hmm?
Chancellor Neighsay_Neutral__how to teach friendship to creatures Who will one day use it as a weapon against us.
Chancellor Neighsay_Sarcastic_Noisy_You tell me, it's your book.

Chrysalis_Angry Shouting__Just, retrieve, the elements!
Chrysalis_Angry_Noisy_how do you think i'm doing!?
Chrysalis_Angry_Noisy_i watched it infect my hive. I will not let it get me!
Chrysalis_Angry_Noisy_i'm ready to exact my revenge!
Chrysalis_Angry_Noisy_yes. until that sow starlight glimmer Freed them, corrupted my subjects, and stole my hive!
Chrysalis_Angry_Very Noisy_There is no revenge you could ever conceive of That will come close to what i will exact upon you One day, starlight glimmer!
Chrysalis_Angry_Very Noisy_To stop trying to absorb my essence!
Chrysalis_Angry__Enough!
Chrysalis_Angry__Enough! Or the dragon's wings get plucked!
Chrysalis_Angry__Get her!
Chrysalis_Angry__How dare you!
Chrysalis_Angry__I will have my revenge!
Chrysalis_Angry__Not annoying! Distracting!
Chrysalis_Angry__So i can destroy starlight's life like she destroyed mine.
Chrysalis_Angry__So i'll take her friends away while she watches.
Chrysalis_Angry__Understand?
Chrysalis_Annoyed_Noisy_Ah, discord was really something until friendship ruined him.
Chrysalis_Annoyed_Noisy_An infection that spreads to those around you.
Chrysalis_Annoyed_Noisy_And then ?
Chrysalis_Annoyed_Noisy_How dare i? do you know to whom you are speaking?
Chrysalis_Annoyed_Noisy_It's not healthy to hold onto all of this rage!
Chrysalis_Annoyed_Noisy_Just so we're clear. i didn't save you because i like you, i did it because.
Chrysalis_Annoyed_Noisy_No he didn't! and even if he did.
Chrysalis_Annoyed_Noisy_We will always return! Nothing will ever stop.
Chrysalis_Annoyed_Noisy_and what of king sombra?
Chrysalis_Annoyed_Noisy_i could lash out at any moment.
Chrysalis_Annoyed_Noisy_it's been weeks and grogar has done nothing!
Chrysalis_Annoyed_Noisy_never!
Chrysalis_Annoyed_Noisy_perhaps if we knew what the plan was, we would be better able to prepare.
Chrysalis_Annoyed_Noisy_the magic of friendship is like a disease.
Chrysalis_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Don't mention that traitor's name in my kingdom!
Chrysalis_Annoyed_Very Noisy_He was a fool to leave, and even more a fool to return.
Chrysalis_Annoyed_Very Noisy_I decide what is best for my subjects, not some mewling grub!
Chrysalis_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Is what happens to those who turn their back on the hive!
Chrysalis_Annoyed_Very Noisy_The only thing thorax has found.
Chrysalis_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Why did you bring us here?
Chrysalis_Annoyed_Very Noisy_You know nothing of the changelings Or what it takes to be their queen!
Chrysalis_Annoyed_Very Noisy_because they cheat.
Chrysalis_Annoyed_Very Noisy_what are you suggesting?
Chrysalis_Annoyed_Very Noisy_why did you summon me? what do you want?
Chrysalis_Annoyed__And we will steal the elements of harmony.
Chrysalis_Annoyed__Give me one good reason why i shouldn't just destroy you all and start over.
Chrysalis_Annoyed__Grub sitting you six is nothing like controlling my hive.
Chrysalis_Annoyed__He's, red.
Chrysalis_Annoyed__How do i know you won't take my magic and leave me?
Chrysalis_Annoyed__I'm sick of waiting for that old goat's master plan.
Chrysalis_Annoyed__Just wait, starlight.
Chrysalis_Annoyed__Not anymore.
Chrysalis_Annoyed__Of course i haven't forgotten starlight glimmer!
Chrysalis_Annoyed__Servants always fail you in the end.
Chrysalis_Annoyed__Servants.
Chrysalis_Annoyed__Stay still so I can blast you!
Chrysalis_Annoyed__The quicker we search the forest, the quicker we find the elements.
Chrysalis_Annoyed__This is ridiculous! where are my other minions?
Chrysalis_Annoyed__Turn around.
Chrysalis_Annoyed__Turned my subjects against me.
Chrysalis_Annoyed__Where, are, the others?
Chrysalis_Annoyed__You think friendship will save you?!
Chrysalis_Annoyed__You will bring them back here.
Chrysalis_Annoyed__You will go out there and find the others.
Chrysalis_Annoyed__You'll pay for that!
Chrysalis_Annoyed__they'd crawl back to defeat us.
Chrysalis_Annoyed__you mean you could be?
Chrysalis_Anxious Shouting_Noisy_no!
Chrysalis_Anxious_Noisy_Betrayal!
Chrysalis_Anxious_Noisy_I, I wasn't sure you were going to give it back.
Chrysalis_Anxious_Noisy_My magic.
Chrysalis_Anxious_Noisy_We just aren't as powerful as you!
Chrysalis_Anxious__no!
Chrysalis_Confused__What is this place?
Chrysalis_Happy_Noisy_I haven't eaten this well in ages.
Chrysalis_Happy_Noisy_Yes, it feels.
Chrysalis_Happy_Noisy_having others who will be there for you Is, pleasing.
Chrysalis_Happy_Noisy_mmmm. so much love!
Chrysalis_Happy__And i will rule as queen once again!
Chrysalis_Happy__Be, able, to, use, them, too!
Chrysalis_Happy__Finally!
Chrysalis_Happy__I'll build a new hive of earth ponies, unicorns and pegasi.
Chrysalis_Happy__Which means you.
Chrysalis_Happy__Will.
Chrysalis_Neutral_Noisy_Forget about that old bell.
Chrysalis_Neutral_Noisy_It looks absolutely delicious!
Chrysalis_Neutral_Noisy_King sombra, you have returned?
Chrysalis_Neutral_Noisy_Of course.
Chrysalis_Neutral_Noisy_See what i mean?
Chrysalis_Neutral_Noisy_We're so much more powerful, when we work as a team.
Chrysalis_Neutral_Noisy_What a lovely village you've chosen To stage your little, resistance.
Chrysalis_Neutral_Noisy_Would that be so terrible?
Chrysalis_Neutral_Noisy_You were right!
Chrysalis_Neutral_Noisy_are you planning on attacking anypony Anytime soon? if not, i don't know why I'm wasting my time here.
Chrysalis_Neutral_Noisy_chrysalis obeys no one.
Chrysalis_Neutral_Noisy_i always save a little for the next day.
Chrysalis_Neutral_Noisy_i will defeat twilight sparkle and her friends, and they will pay for stealing my kingdom!
Chrysalis_Neutral_Noisy_or at least i will be, when i'm restored to my rightful place.
Chrysalis_Neutral_Noisy_retrieve grogar's bell.
Chrysalis_Neutral_Very Noisy_And show my subjects what a real leader is.
Chrysalis_Neutral_Very Noisy_By replacing the most beloved figures in equestria.
Chrysalis_Neutral_Very Noisy_Everypony will do as i command, and my subjects And i will feed on their love for generations!
Chrysalis_Neutral_Very Noisy_Excellent. and i've just received word That the princesses from canterlot have successfully Been replaced as well.
Chrysalis_Neutral_Very Noisy_Honestly, i didn't think you were worth replacing With one of my drones.
Chrysalis_Neutral_Very Noisy_I don't do meetings.
Chrysalis_Neutral_Very Noisy_Just as soon as i drain every last ounce of love from him.
Chrysalis_Neutral_Very Noisy_Much better. now report.
Chrysalis_Neutral_Very Noisy_My drones will be able to store all the love meant for them, And return it here, to me.
Chrysalis_Neutral_Very Noisy_Nopony can stop us.
Chrysalis_Neutral_Very Noisy_One ponynapped princess wasn't enough.
Chrysalis_Neutral_Very Noisy_So i could feed, of course!
Chrysalis_Neutral_Very Noisy_The hunger of changelings can never be satisfied.
Chrysalis_Neutral_Very Noisy_Ugh, i can't take any of you seriously When you look like that.
Chrysalis_Neutral_Very Noisy_Very clever. and clearly thorax revealed to you the secret Of my throne.
Chrysalis_Neutral_Very Noisy_We thought too small last time.
Chrysalis_Neutral_Very Noisy_When i find him, he'll learn just what happens To those who betray the hive.
Chrysalis_Neutral_Very Noisy_With all the most beloved ponies of equestria taken care of.
Chrysalis_Neutral_Very Noisy_chrysalis, queen of the changelings.
Chrysalis_Neutral_Very Noisy_i can't have powerful ponies using their abilities against me.
Chrysalis_Neutral_Very Noisy_one day, you'll see.
Chrysalis_Neutral_Very Noisy_tartarus? whoever pulled you from there must have been somepony very powerful indeed.
Chrysalis_Neutral_Very Noisy_the princess of friendship's sole pupil.
Chrysalis_Neutral_Very Noisy_well it sounded easy.
Chrysalis_Neutral__All i need is an image, and a piece of the pony.
Chrysalis_Neutral__Almost there.
Chrysalis_Neutral__And serve me.
Chrysalis_Neutral__And the power of the elements.
Chrysalis_Neutral__And then, i'll destroy her!
Chrysalis_Neutral__Careful, Too close and the shards cancel even our powers.
Chrysalis_Neutral__Come out come out wherever you are!
Chrysalis_Neutral__Destruction is so, permanent.
Chrysalis_Neutral__Do it.
Chrysalis_Neutral__Excuse me?
Chrysalis_Neutral__Fear!
Chrysalis_Neutral__I don't think we should. This could work out quite well for me.
Chrysalis_Neutral__I haven't felt like this since before i lost my hive.
Chrysalis_Neutral__I know better than to strike alone.
Chrysalis_Neutral__I learned they were hidden somewhere in this forest.
Chrysalis_Neutral__I need.
Chrysalis_Neutral__Leave it in the Bell. We've got a kingdom to conquer.
Chrysalis_Neutral__Let's see if you're telling the truth about this tree.
Chrysalis_Neutral__Let's try the spell before Grogar gets back.
Chrysalis_Neutral__Listen to your queen!
Chrysalis_Neutral__Mm perhaps, as long as it results In the complete destruction of our enemies.
Chrysalis_Neutral__My spell can create a copy of anypony i desire.
Chrysalis_Neutral__Nopony leaves without my say so.
Chrysalis_Neutral__Oh, and this.
Chrysalis_Neutral__Oh, thank you, applejack.
Chrysalis_Neutral__Once Equestria is a frozen wasteland, we'll use our magic to destroy those windy beasts.
Chrysalis_Neutral__Once we defeat the protectors of Equestria.
Chrysalis_Neutral__Our pact stands. What we do, we do together.
Chrysalis_Neutral__Patience, Cozy.
Chrysalis_Neutral__She stole my hive.
Chrysalis_Neutral__Something must be done about that.
Chrysalis_Neutral__That much chaos magic in our veins.
Chrysalis_Neutral__The harsh weather is the final blow to break the ponies' spirits.
Chrysalis_Neutral__The location of the most powerful weapon in equestria isn't something made known to just anypony.
Chrysalis_Neutral__The most powerful weapon in all equestria.
Chrysalis_Neutral__The time for my revenge on starlight glimmer has come!
Chrysalis_Neutral__There, that's all of you.
Chrysalis_Neutral__They've defeated my army.
Chrysalis_Neutral__Threats are more my speed. Speak!
Chrysalis_Neutral__Together, we will destroy twilight sparkle and her meddlesome friends.
Chrysalis_Neutral__Very well.
Chrysalis_Neutral__We have been planning this for quite some time.
Chrysalis_Neutral__We must retrieve the elements of harmony!
Chrysalis_Neutral__We need to show the rest of Equestria that we've broken their heroes first.
Chrysalis_Neutral__We should take the magic inside it.
Chrysalis_Neutral__We're going back.
Chrysalis_Neutral__Why copies? Because princess twilight and her friends control the elements of harmony.
Chrysalis_Neutral__With the elements under my control.
Chrysalis_Neutral__Yes, i know.
Chrysalis_Neutral__You have my permission.
Chrysalis_Neutral__You know how powerful Discord was.
Chrysalis_Neutral__Your plan?
Chrysalis_Neutral__grogar is too powerful.
Chrysalis_Neutral__perhaps i should be the one to lead us.
Chrysalis_Neutral__thanks to Grogar's Bell.
Chrysalis_Neutral__we can claim this land and rule our kingdoms alone once more.
Chrysalis_Sad Sarcastic_Noisy_I made a detailed list of all the ways i'm a failure!
Chrysalis_Sad__I created you!
Chrysalis_Sarcastic_Noisy_I'm a pathetic pony princess!
Chrysalis_Sarcastic_Very Noisy_Oh, how will i ever prevent this daring rescue?
Chrysalis_Sarcastic_Very Noisy_if we are to trust one another, Perhaps inform lord tirek.
Chrysalis_Sarcastic__but as long as they have the love of Equestria behind them.
Chrysalis_Shouting_Very Noisy_Go! feed!
Chrysalis_Smug Annoyed__Wrong. I can hurt you!
Chrysalis_Smug Sarcastic_Very Noisy_until gusty the great rose up and banished you.
Chrysalis_Smug Sarcastic__Is that big, strong minotaur that scared of one little pony?
Chrysalis_Smug Sarcastic__Isn't that right, Grogar?
Chrysalis_Smug_Noisy_And as queen of the changelings, it is up to me to find food For my subjects.
Chrysalis_Smug_Noisy_And i'm sorry to say, unable to perform his duties as captain of the royal guard.
Chrysalis_Smug_Noisy_Equestria has more love than any place i've ever encountered.
Chrysalis_Smug_Noisy_He may not be my husband, but he is under my total control now.
Chrysalis_Smug_Noisy_I did, didn't i?
Chrysalis_Smug_Noisy_It's all over!
Chrysalis_Smug_Noisy_It's funny, really.
Chrysalis_Smug_Noisy_Oh come now, zecora. You're vastly outnumbered!
Chrysalis_Smug_Noisy_Oh, i doubt that.
Chrysalis_Smug_Noisy_Oh, way ahead of you, Grogar.
Chrysalis_Smug_Noisy_Right you are, princess.
Chrysalis_Smug_Noisy_Soon, my changeling army will break through.
Chrysalis_Smug_Noisy_Twilight here was suspicious of my behavior all along.
Chrysalis_Smug_Noisy_What a lovely but absolutely ridiculous sentiment.
Chrysalis_Smug_Noisy_What good would that do? my changelings already roam free.
Chrysalis_Smug_Noisy_You do realize the reception's been cancelled, don't you?
Chrysalis_Smug_Noisy_as if anything on this mountain is scarier than i.
Chrysalis_Smug_Noisy_i am a queen, you know!
Chrysalis_Smug_Noisy_i have come close to ruling equestria several times.
Chrysalis_Smug_Noisy_let grogar think we're his loyal servants.
Chrysalis_Smug_Very Noisy_And i promise to leave the others alone.
Chrysalis_Smug_Very Noisy_And it seems i don't have far to look, do i?
Chrysalis_Smug_Very Noisy_Consuming him has made me even more powerful than celestia!
Chrysalis_Smug_Very Noisy_Don't wanna go back to the caves, now do you?
Chrysalis_Smug_Very Noisy_Even with your rather embarrassing Little rescue attempt, everything has gone According to my plan.
Chrysalis_Smug_Very Noisy_Ever since i took your place, i've been feeding off shining armor's love for you.
Chrysalis_Smug_Very Noisy_Every moment he grows weaker, and so does his spell.
Chrysalis_Smug_Very Noisy_First we take canterlot. and then, all of equestria!
Chrysalis_Smug_Very Noisy_I already have. nopony is coming to save you.
Chrysalis_Smug_Very Noisy_I know you don't want your charges hurt. Come quietly to the dungeons of Canterlot.
Chrysalis_Smug_Very Noisy_Isn't that right, dear?
Chrysalis_Smug_Very Noisy_My fellow changelings will be able to devour so much of it.
Chrysalis_Smug_Very Noisy_Shining armor's love for you is even stronger than i thought!
Chrysalis_Smug_Very Noisy_That we will gain more power than we have ever dreamed of!
Chrysalis_Smug_Very Noisy_Time to make a decision, zecora!
Chrysalis_Smug_Very Noisy_Too bad the rest of you were too caught up in your wedding planning To realize those suspicions were correct.
Chrysalis_Smug_Very Noisy_You can run, but you can't hide!
Chrysalis_Smug_Very Noisy_Your little squad was it, and now there's just you.
Chrysalis_Smug_Very Noisy_one little pony all by herself.
Chrysalis_Smug_Very Noisy_uh uh uh.
Chrysalis_Smug__A whisper here, a rumor there.
Chrysalis_Smug__Ah. Just the headmare I want to see.
Chrysalis_Smug__Besides, we have plans.
Chrysalis_Smug__Besides, we should have fun with our guests.
Chrysalis_Smug__But on this side of the cavern, we're the most powerful beings in Equestria.
Chrysalis_Smug__Even now my minions are chipping away at it.
Chrysalis_Smug__Everywhere.
Chrysalis_Smug__Face it, Twilight. You've lost!
Chrysalis_Smug__Now I'll have all eternity to take my revenge on you!
Chrysalis_Smug__Ponies will be so grateful, they'll do whatever I want!
Chrysalis_Smug__Relax. It's not like her friends are going anywhere.
Chrysalis_Smug__Spreading distrust among the unicorns and Earth ponies is almost too easy.
Chrysalis_Smug__Starlight, star bright. Where's the pony I want to fight?!
Chrysalis_Smug__The Pillars have been defeated. Your school is abandoned.
Chrysalis_Smug__The fools brought the remains of my throne to Canterlot to protect themselves.
Chrysalis_Smug__Those shards block their magic.
Chrysalis_Smug__Until your whole kingdom is on edge, waiting for just one tiny thing to push them over the brink!
Chrysalis_Smug__We could take down Twilight and her friends a hundred times.
Chrysalis_Smug__Without magic he's no threat.
Chrysalis_Smug__You just can't accept that you were beaten before you even realized there was a fight, can you?
Chrysalis_Smug__You know what's stronger than friendship, Twilight?
Chrysalis_Smug__You think your pathetic shield can stop us?
Chrysalis_Smug__You were saying?
Chrysalis_Smug__apparently i don't need anypony else.
Chrysalis_Smug__in the meantime, we'll hatch our own plan.
Chrysalis_Smug__the ease of this task is laughable.
Chrysalis_Surprised_Noisy_the grogar?

Clear Sky_Anxious_Noisy_Quibble! where have you been?
Clear Sky_Anxious_Noisy_This is wonderful q, but i still feel like you're trying too hard to get wind's approval.
Clear Sky_Anxious_Noisy_i know! but i told you you didn't need to.
Clear Sky_Anxious_Noisy_you and i have to rethink all of this.
Clear Sky_Anxious__Q, wind really doesn't need any more surprises.
Clear Sky_Anxious__i was hoping we'd all watch the tournament together.
Clear Sky_Confused_Noisy_calling it quits? what are you talking about?
Clear Sky_Neutral_Noisy_And i feel the same way about you.
Clear Sky_Neutral_Noisy_Sure honey.
Clear Sky_Neutral_Noisy_This is my daughter, wind sprint.
Clear Sky_Neutral_Noisy_Yeah, things like having your friend Help you pretend to be a sports pony so wind would like you.
Clear Sky_Neutral_Noisy_huh. looks like you didn't need sportiness, famous ponies, or lavish gifts To bond with wind after all.
Clear Sky_Neutral_Noisy_i guess even sports ponies agree, Quibble's a pony you like more and more over time.
Clear Sky_Neutral_Noisy_wind, did you thank quibble for camping out, So we'd be first in line?
Clear Sky_Neutral_Noisy_wow! you'd better watch out or you're gonna start to like books.
Clear Sky_Neutral_Very Noisy_no. quibble planned this whole thing for us and you, could be a little more appreciative.
Clear Sky_Neutral__And his friends certainly seem to care about him Which is always a good sign.
Clear Sky_Neutral__And i think maybe there's enough room in your heart to do both.
Clear Sky_Neutral__Everything's going to be fine.
Clear Sky_Neutral__He just wants you to like him.
Clear Sky_Neutral__Listen q this trip was a lovely idea and the book was sweet but, you don't have to try so hard.
Clear Sky_Neutral__None taken. when it comes to describing Your special somepony, a little exaggeration's normal.
Clear Sky_Neutral__because he's kind, and smart.
Clear Sky_Neutral__quibble thought you'd like it.
Clear Sky_Sad Anxious_Noisy_Oh sweetheart, i know quibble's trying too hard,.
Clear Sky_Sad Anxious__But he doesn't want you to stop loving your dad.

Coco Pommel_Amused_Noisy_You bet your boots we were!
Coco Pommel_Anxious_Noisy_And i'm afraid i haven't made much progress.
Coco Pommel_Anxious_Noisy_Oh, there's just so much to do to bring back the midsummer revival.
Coco Pommel_Anxious_Very Noisy_And even if we had, we don't have a stage For the method mares to perform on!
Coco Pommel_Anxious_Very Noisy_But i've barely started the costumes for the revival And the method mares are coming to the park tomorrow For a costume fitting and rehearsal!
Coco Pommel_Anxious_Very Noisy_But i've just gotten a last minute request To alter costumes for the cast of my fair filly.
Coco Pommel_Anxious_Very Noisy_But, what are we going to do about the rest?
Coco Pommel_Anxious_Very Noisy_I finished the alterations for my fair filly.
Coco Pommel_Anxious_Very Noisy_The park is in desperate need of repairs, And the sets still need to be built!
Coco Pommel_Anxious__And my flyers haven't attracted a single volunteer!

Coco Pommel_Neutral_Noisy_Many moons ago, local theatre troupes would perform, And ponies in the neighborhood would help Make the costumes, and design setpieces.
Coco Pommel_Neutral_Noisy_No matter how busy she was, she always made time for the revival.
Coco Pommel_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, i don't wear boots.
Coco Pommel_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, yes! we've just put the finishing touches on the costumes.

Coco Pommel_Neutral_Very Noisy_My dear friends rarity and applejack, helped me ever so much.
Coco Pommel_Neutral_Very Noisy_Quite a coincidence, don't you think?
Coco Pommel_Neutral_Very Noisy_The neighborhood lost the special tradition she had started.
Coco Pommel_Neutral__And it seems it means quite a lot to all of you as well.
Coco Pommel_Neutral__I really can't take all the credit though.
Coco Pommel_Neutral__It was.
Coco Pommel_Neutral__That's charity kindheart.
Coco Pommel_Neutral__The midsummer theatre revival was, always Something that meant so much to me.
Coco Pommel_Neutral__Up until several moons ago.
Coco Pommel_Sad_Noisy_And worse, the sense of community it fostered.
Coco Pommel_Sad_Noisy_It's hopeless.
Coco Pommel_Sad_Noisy_Just, hopeless!
Coco Pommel_Sad_Noisy_The park is still a mess.
Coco Pommel_Sad_Noisy_To bring my neighborhood together again.
Coco Pommel_Sad_Noisy_We haven't even thought about what refreshments To serve during the performance.
Coco Pommel_Sad_Very Noisy_I just wanted to live up to charity's example,.
Coco Pommel_Sad__I suppose so.

Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_A seven letter word for teamwork.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Actually, you can.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_And as headmare of the school of friendship.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_And dragons are so fierce compared to us.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_And how are you doing this.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_And if i can't do it here, i'll do it somewhere else!
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_And since grogar left me in charge.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_And when you say this school will be run According to e e a doctrine, i know you mean it.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_And, when you say there won't be any more lessons From the princess of friendship, at the school of friendship, I guess you mean that too.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Are we going to give the pony who already tried to wreck Twilight's school once, another chance to do it?
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Being cooped up with nothing to do is the worst.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_But don't worry, because she left me in charge.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_But to tell you the truth, the thing i need help with most is cleaning.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_But, twilight decided to run her school Outside of the e e a guidelines. And even though you tried to stop her.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Can you absorb it and make it go away?
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Didn't we learn about a creature that eats magic?
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Do you?
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Don't worry.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Even other griffons.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Everypony know yaks think yaks are best.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Golly, it's so inspiring how relaxed you all are about Studying friendship.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Grogar left me in charge.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Grogar wants us to work together to defeat our enemies.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Headmare twilight is giving us a big test At the end of the week. And i could really use your help studying.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Honesty? Loyalty? Generosity?
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_I also color coded your teaching schedule by friendship element, And cataloged all the magical artifacts in the school.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_I asked professor rainbow dash to cover for you.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_I could use some help with my homework.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_I finished straightening up in the library.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_I have to do something nice for each of these ponies.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_I have to go, twilight needs my help.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_I heard they might do some sight seeing first.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_I know we're all sad professor sparkle is away.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_I marked whose is whose just in case.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_I mean, growing up as a love starved changeling?
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_I nearly drained all the magic from equestria!
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_I thought you freed us from tartarus.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_I volunteered to help professor sparkle organize these books.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_I wouldn't have it any other way.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_I'll get you an extension.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_I'm sorry i ever doubted you.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_I'm sure twilight will know what to do with him When she gets back.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_If tirek absorbs your energy, he might be strong enough to break through.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_In the meantime, what do we do with this?
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Is it, control?
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_It looks like you need help carrying your cactus So here's a safe way to take it home.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_It must get lonely all by yourself. Maybe i could be your, friend?
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_It's just like our professors taught us, Together, we can get through anything!
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Laughter?
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Making friends with any other creature Must seem like a step down.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_No, um, these are for you.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Of course, that's just the beginning.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Oh smolder, You forget. we're not scheming dragons.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Oh! i'll let you borrow my notes! it's what friends do.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, golly! she's away on a quest. I'm watching the school for her.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, i do! you just aren't the pony i had in mind.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, i'm just keeping twilight's seat warm.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Ok normally yes, we would.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Or hiding underwater from an evil king all those years?
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Princesses celestia and luna trusted her enough to support her.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_See you soon!
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_She was. but she left me this note.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_So i've scheduled a team meeting!
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_So since i know you mean what you say, My question is really for the students.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_So you do have a place for them here?
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_So? experts on friendship history yet?
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Starlight can't stand mustard.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Then, he gives it back.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_There must be days you can't wait to get away From all us cute ponies.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_There'll be cupcakes.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_These came too, I wasn't sure what to make of them.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_This is why grogar left me in charge.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Trusting any creature must be so hard for you.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Twilight didn't just run off willy nilly.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Uh huh. i told her how busy you are, And how much her loyalty meant to you.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Um, Didn't we learn in class about a creature that eats magic?
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Um, intelligence?
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_We won't let starlight down, will we?
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Well actually, you can start right in here.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_What with the magical crisis going on.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_When we helped each other it felt better somehow.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_Would we do that to you?
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_You know what you need?
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_You know, there is something i need help with.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_You might be the princess of friendship, But as headmare of this school, I can collect even more friends than you.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_You really think missus cake will like these new sprinkle shakers?
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_You see if there's one thing i've learned here, It's that friendship is the most powerful thing there is.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_You're gonna have to exercise a lot To get as big as you were When you absorbed the life force of all those ponies.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_You're such good friends.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_a team meeting!
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_anyhoo, grogar wants us all to work together.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_but, grogar said we have to work together.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_but, you might like to know he left food out. again.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_didn't you already drain it of love?
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_i don't want to tattle on my good friend tirek.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_i just want to make sure you can see my best friends rock sculpture from over there.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_if we aren't meeting i guess i could just stay and offer positive and inspiring.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_it just doesn't ring any bell.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_meh. i think big.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_mhm.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_not betrayal. teamwork.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_nothing says teamwork like an inspirational banner.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_now i'll say something nice about centaurs.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_so when you pony napped twilight and the others, you cocooned them.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_someone's a real grumpy taur today.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_tirek, you say something nice about changelings.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_when grogar sees this, He'll realize there's no way he could survive without me.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_when you use your power to help others.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_which means we need to trust each other.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Noisy_who knows how behind you'd be?
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Very Noisy_After everything twilight's done for you.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Very Noisy_All of equestria will bow to me!
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Very Noisy_All this magic needs time to drain from equestria Before my vortex sucks it to another realm.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Very Noisy_Don't give any of this another thought.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Very Noisy_Friendship is power!
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Very Noisy_Friendship isn't magic.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Very Noisy_I can't very well have the e e a running the school If i want to run it myself.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Very Noisy_I just need some advice.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Very Noisy_Just let cozy take care of everything.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Very Noisy_Maybe not you.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, oh, not too tight. We don't want to hurt the chancellor.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh. i thought that after what happened last time.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Very Noisy_They brought this on themselves. There's nothing we can do.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Very Noisy_They're just not applicable in every circumstance.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Very Noisy_Three days can sure seem like forever huh?
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Very Noisy_Wah! oh golly, we didn't bring you.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Very Noisy_We all just saw you with your claws all over them.
Cozy Glow_Neutral_Very Noisy_We have to defend the school!

Discord_Neutral_Noisy_And i'm almost certain she likes stairs that lead somewhere.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_And i'm sure it was much more important than the fun that we had.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_And if they're not, this rare opportunity to focus on their friendship will certainly bring them closer.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_And just in time.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_And never thinking about yours.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_And now, i have it.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_And over a girl, no less.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_And rob you of a valuable lesson about being princess?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_And that's why you're the party expert.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_And what did you say?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_And what else could we possibly need?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_And yet you look so glum.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Anyone can plainly see that i'm not, big at all.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Anything at all?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Anything stand out as being different?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Anytime. i really do love being helpful.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Are you perhaps looking for me?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Aren't i lucky?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_As a bird.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_As a sign of our friendship.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_As headdraconequus.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_As the party pony and fluttershy's close.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Because you'll always be watching, and you weren't there.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Before you summon me with that little spell she gave you.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Being her mentor and all that.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Being turned to stone doesn't keep me from hearing every word celestia says.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Besides, we can't have you ruining any more of my thousand year old monogrammed handkerchiefs.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Better.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Blue flu.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_But i couldn't possibly take responsibility.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_But it's an it with a heart of, well, glob.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_But not on the ceiling.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_But only to pay off skeleton student loan debts.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_But rarity and applejack already volunteered to be my own personal nursemaids.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_But she won't believe you. oh, i don't need to be here for this.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_But then we'd miss out on all these delightful misadventures.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_But tirek offered me so much more than just tea parties.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_But we're all very excited to hear what you've cooked up.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_But what's important here, is that it was never my intent To make twilight feel jealous, That's something that the old me would have tried to do.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_But when i say that it is a sign of our true friendship, i am telling the truth.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_But, i will need my own office, expense account, parking space.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Butter fingers.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_By seeing if you would go to the ends of equestria for me, of course.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_By the way, i hope you like limburger cheese.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Can i suggest we take a break and, i don't know, Go out and have some fun?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Can i trouble you for another sugar cube?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Can we play o and o now?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Care for a quick game of ogres and oubliettes?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Carry me?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Chaos, is a wonderful, wonderful thing.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Chocolate milkshakes?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Come in, come in, you'll let the twittermites out.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Contagious.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Could somebody find me, a fainting couch?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Da dee la! i'm opposite discord.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Darn it. i was hoping you'd send her to my realm.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Did i hear you two talking, about princess cadance's visit with princess twilight?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Did you ever notice how you always materialize out of thin air?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Did you miss me, celestia?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Disturb them? why, wouldn't dream of it.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Do you think it's a gouda idea?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Don't wrap it, i'll walk it home.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_During the party, to make the grand announcement To everypony about your plan.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Eh, all you apples look the same.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Er, tree hugger, i'm sorry that you got caught in the middle of my Er, you know, wrath.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Everything is fine here, bye bye.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Everything is re-hidden.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Excuse me.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Famous ponies charades?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Fascinating article, yes?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Fear not. your romantic delusions are safe with me.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Fine. call it a gentleman's wager.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Fluttershy deserves the best of everything.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Fluttershy had mentioned, that those two were getting together today.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Fluttershy?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_For fluttershy!
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Fourteen or lower, and, well, ha ha you get the idea.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Friends and family day? baccalaureate?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Friendship is about honesty.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Glow fly fold, into fun shapes, perhaps?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Glow, fly and oh, and fold!
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Gone?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Good, but not nearly good enough for fluttershy.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Greetings, friend.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Happy hearts and hooves day, sugar belle.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Happy now?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Hating it.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Hating it.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Have fun at the gala!
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Haven't you girls just learned so much?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Hello?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Her destiny falls squarely on your haunches.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Her trip, to see the breezies. Oh yes well i had forgotten that that was today.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Hey, i'm here to deliver a message.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_How 'bout, discord.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_How are we even supposed to get to the hive?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_How boring.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_How can they be happy if they aren't playing ogres and oubliettes?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_How do i make my tea party for her Even more perfect?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_How ever did you save the day this time?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_How is the fact that twilight decided to put an incompetent, Power hungry unicorn in charge of her school.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_How wonderful for them both.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I almost left with the little journal you've all been keeping.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I also couldn't help but notice that you need a refill.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I came to find the one pony who truly understands me and could nurse me back to health.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I can assure you that for the first time, I'm feeling perfectly normal.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I can't wait to tell fluttershy and the others.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I certainly am. You've clearly out dueled me.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I don't know about you, but i sometimes wonder how close they could actually be.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I don't know.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I don't think so. let's have a drink.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I dont want to get anypony else sick.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I fear i've already given it to poor applejack and rarity.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I feel so much better now.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I just needed some assurance, that you truly considered this a team effort.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I know a trick, that'll turn celestia's castle into cheese.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I know just the gal to make you forget all about sugar belle.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I may have let it slip that you'd be unveiling your big plan for starlight tonight. silly me.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I mean, i'm separated from the group And just happen to come across the one pony i care most about?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I need to make this a party of one for a little while.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I only bring it up because she said that she's been feeling Like her role as a princess doesn't equate to much.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I owe you an apology smooze.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I seem to recall a whole song about how this school Is where you make your own rules.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I simply took them to ensure there's no cheating. You see, this is the first rule of our game.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I so hope you don't mind pinkie pie.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I suppose that's correct.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I suppose that's rarity's influence.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I think you'll be quite pleased with the green tea I've selected for us today.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I thought you appreciated a good laugh.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I thought you were joking. you are joking, right?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I want only the best for my friend fluttershy.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I was there and i said to myself i said.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I was trying to make the tea party different and special, Like me.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I was, but i had a very good reason.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I would! i-i would!
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I'm Discord.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I'm a realist. And love, like all things warm and fuzzy, isn't real.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I'm afraid the feeling isn't mutual.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I'm calling an emergency guys' night right now, to cheer you up.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I'm centuries old!
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I'm doing her a favor, fluttershy!
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I'm just sorry that all this bonding happened While you were holed up in your castle.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I'm just surprised that you agreed to their plan.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I'm not playing fair?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I'm not, we will need to make some arrangements.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I'm off to prepare a tea party worthy of fluttershy!
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I'm partial to something upbeat and jazzy.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I'm reformed, don't you remember?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I've been taking advantage of your hospitality For far too long.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I've bookmarked a few more interesting passages you really should take a look!
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_I've made a list of the rowdiest establishments In ponyville.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_If i weren't so evolved, i might decide to take it personally.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_If the wrong choice you choose to pursue, The foundations of home will crumble without you.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_If twilight has magic to give.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_If you ever need a little chaos in your act, let me know.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Imagine what twilight would say.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_In fact i feel. completely normal.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_In fact she can't break your heart, if you break hers first.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_In fact, clear the whole evening.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_In short, i need help.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Is something amiss?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Is this seat taken?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Is this where fluttershy usually buys her tea?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Isn't this what every gamer wants? To live the game?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_It got me thinking, what if what's locked inside Is something that could help her prove her royal worth?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_It has only served to prove that moments Of levity and bonding between friends.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_It is certainly a pleasure to have such dedicated fans.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_It probably got lost in the mail. No biggie', as the folks say.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_It started when we were helping granny smith with her garden.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_It will be yours.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_It would just mean that I'd have different friends for different things.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_It's hard being different.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_It's just at the top of that hill.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_It's just great to be here with my oldest, bestest friend.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_It's just, that i couldn't help but notice that twilight hasn't yet opened this little chest of hers.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_It's not because my little exam put a dampfer on your visit with princess cadance, is it?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_It's so much more complicated than it looks.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Item one, gravity is optional.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Item two, the school's new mascot, Is an ambidextrous marmoset.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Just kidding. she wanted it to be a big surprise.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Just knowing that i have a good friend like you.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Just the pony i need.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Lesson one, nothing can break your heart if you only love yourself.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Let me explain it to you as simply as i can.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Let me show you how it's done.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Let the healing begin.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Listen closely. this is important.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Loser mows my lawn for eternity.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Make them glow.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Maybe i just need another set of eyes on this.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Me? amazing. them? well, i've already forgotten Who we're talking about. you see?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Much better.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_My my my, you do seem like you're in over your head.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_No flying, and no magic.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_No matter how hard we try We can't possibly recreate our weekend of fun, exactly as it happened.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_No no no no no, this is barely room temperature!
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_No no no no no.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_No really, i can't.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_No time!
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_No, i think you just made them mad.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Normally i'm the most distracting thing I can think of, but without magic.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Not a guy who leans on things that cool.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Not when i have two such dear friends on my own, who have already offered to take care of me.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Now let me top you off.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Now let's play before this evening gets any sappier, Shall we?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Now let's see, i have the perfect tea And the perfect tea service.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Now listen, smooze.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Now now now, the smooze may be an it.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Now that she's a princess, maybe she has decided that she is too good for you.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Now that sounds promising, What does it sing?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Now who better at that than me?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Now's the part where you all tell little sparkle here That everything is going to be fine.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Now, twilight, you know princess celestia said that you were to give me a heads up.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Obviously you should have a grand master plan for her, The same way celestia set you on a path That eventually made you a princess.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Of course none of this would've happened, if i hadn't Encouraged everypony not to invite you this weekend.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Of course not. that whole jealousy thing was just a happy accident.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Of course we do. we're friends.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Of course, i should get her the best of everything, Why didn't i think of that?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Of course. Love is something something, and discord is great.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Of ogres and oubliettes, did you not?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oh dear fluttershy worry not.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oh dear, this could be pretty embarrassing for you.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oh don't worry, i'll cover for you.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oh haha, how interesting.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oh interesting, Does it decorate your hips in roses or turn you green?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oh no.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oh this is an easy one. who am i?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oh well this should do!
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oh well.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oh you keep saying that, but i haven't seen An actual changeling since we got into this hive.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oh! Are you finally finished? I've been done for a while.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oh! salutations, my friend!
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oh! seems like i got here just in time.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, dear dear princesses.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, good. i'm sure she can't wait to hear all about it.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, he did not.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, how about a different game?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, i can see why you like these clouds so much Very plush.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, i hate seeing you like this big mac.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, i'll need napkins.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, i've never hosted a tea party before, So much to do!
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, just a bit of light reading before i head off on my extremely important mission.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, just before you go, just a little small request.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, like a secret code. how about if i say we are.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, most definitely.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, no no no no, i mean, while she's gone, you ponies can take care of me.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, of course.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, quite strange, for the first time in my life, I don't feel quite strange.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, starlight.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, tree hugger, you're such a great friend.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, wait, did you.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, was i not invited to the grand opening?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, we were just reminiscing about the, best weekend ever!
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, you don't say.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Ok chief, what's the plan?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Ok fellas, this is a good start, but stand back.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Ok, let's give these conversation cards a whirl.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Ok, since fluttershy always goes out of her way To host the perfect tea party for me.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Ok.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_One change to the equation could ruin the experiment.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_One of us should probably loop in the real rulers Of equestria.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_One thing i know about my dear friend, Is that she loves comfy chairs.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Ooh! i heard some of the changelings, Who were chasing me, say that they know where it is.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oooh. good point.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Or we could go cause a little mischief.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Oy vey.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Pinkie pie?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Piñatas hate bats.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Princess twilight has something very important to tell us.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Probably because you're not as close as you think you are.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Pushed on you by the greeting card industry.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Really, that's so inconsiderate.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Really? i thought there must be some mistake.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Reeeeeeally?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Relax, we can fix this.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Right here.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Sand like powdered sugar.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_See for yourself.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Seventeen! lucky you!
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Shall the three of us head back to your place?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Shall we begin with the lunch date that kicked off The glorious weekend you missed out on?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Shall we storm the ramparts of squizard's castle?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_She has so much potential.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_She makes us want to be a better draconequus.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_She was our first friend, after all.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_She's a level eighteen bone warrior, in squizard's mage army.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Shh!
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Sir mcbiggins, meet skellinore.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Smoozie! wait up!
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_So believe me when i say.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_So fluttershy.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_So was confusion, apparently.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_So, what are we going to do with her?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Something especially special.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Sort of a juvenile nickname, don't you think?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Speaking of how great i am, are you busy for the rest of the night?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Spike, love is about spying in the bushes.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Such accusations.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Suit yourselves.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Sure, she's on the quieter side and i'm a bit, Well, more showy.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Take a lap, team!
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Technically the fun starts when i arrive But i'll make sure it's around sunset. adieu, fellas.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Tell me, have you seen fluttershy anywhere?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Thank you, pinkie pie.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_That box contains your wings.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_That does sound fun actually.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_That reminds me of something i heard at the market today.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_The blue skin, these sneezes.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_The second rule is, Everypony has to play, or the game is over, and i win.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_The tablecloth. it isn't the same color as The one the restaurant used on the day in question.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_There you go, Back to normal, just the way you like it.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_There, all better.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_These are silk, you know.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_These fellas invited me to spice things up And bring a little class to the whole affair.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_They took fluttershy?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_This flu of mine is highly.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_This is how cool guys lean against things.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Those seeds i planted should've spurted up ages ago.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Tirek tricked me to believing he could offer me something more valuable than friendship.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Tirek, i presume?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_To fill in for twilight of course.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_To reclaim calico's ring of imperceptibility?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Too bad there won't be a date.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Tree, friend, is it?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Trendy coats, bedrolls, saddlebags?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Very well, i will fix it.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Way to not pick up what i was putting down.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_We are.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_We just need some of this.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_We know fluttershy, and we know what she likes.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_We literally trotted for our lives.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_We need to make this place more fluttershy and less, Well, me.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Well done everybody but there's still more work to do.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Well finally, some pony to give me the benefit of the doubt.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Well i couldn't travel that far in my condition.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Well i didn't think that they should interrupt you.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Well i don't know about the rest of you But i feel we've been pretty exhaustive in our attempts To recreate.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Well i mean that's what we called him back in college.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Well i'm sure that she wouldn't mind If i made a few tiny suggestions.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Well in any case, i suppose Now is as good a time as any to make my exit.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Well it's hardly my fault if the soup tureen Finds the term, something fishy, to be offensive.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Well it's not my fault the new train route Leads into an active volcano. guess you'll have to stay.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Well she certainly doesn't seem to have appreciated it.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Well that's ok, because i've never hosted a tea party before.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Well then, it seems we've reached an impasse. I'm telling the truth, but you think i'm lying.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Well, i can just pop us in some more.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Well, i mean that shouldn't be a problem.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Well, i must be off.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Well, i suppose i could squeeze you in If i moved a few very important ponies around.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Well, isn't this quite the combination Of secondary characters.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Well, just you really, but i'm nosey and i want to hear.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Well, obviously things didn't go according to my original plan.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Well, that's a terrible plan.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Well, twilight was just about to reveal Her grand master plan, for you.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Well, wait a few minutes and you'll see it in the beautiful light of day.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Well, you two certainly have bought into this, romance nonsense, hook line and sinker.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_What do friends like us do a situation like this, princess twilight?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_What do you think of my brilliant, Genius, amazing idea, Of having the next tea party at my place?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_What do you think?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_What else do i need for the perfect tea party?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_What kind of a friend do you think i am?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_What to do. what to do.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_What? this is all so predictable.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Whatever twilight's planning for starlight Is going to be so exciting!
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_When i say it that way, the game doesn't sound half bad.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_When you're a creature of chaos, Stone bodysuits aren't your typical go to fashion choice.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Where are those little trinkets of yours? you know, the ones you used to send me Back to my extremely uncomfortable stone prison.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Where are twilight and the girls?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Where is that dear sweet fluttershy?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_While i would love to sit around chit chatting About feeding and not feeding.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Who could i bring on such short notice?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Who, me?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Why are you here again?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Why didn't i see that coming?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Why don't i host the next tea party, at my place?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Why don't you host the next tea party?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Why i'm a student of friendship, of course.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Yeah! the peanut butter hoof gang!
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Yes yes yes, of course.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Yes yes yes, of course.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Yes yes, i'm amazing.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Yes you can, your finest tea set, please.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Yes, because you did it all by yourself.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Yes, but when the throne is destroyed, I'll be able to rip the very fabric of reality To save our friends.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Yes, i'd say we were both fairly interested.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Yes, princess i'm, ready to use my magic For good instead of evil.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Yes, starlight is student of the year, isn't she?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Yes, well, as i was saying.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Yes, what did she do to deserve this?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_Yo! greetings, fellow creatures.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_You already planned the perfect moment.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_You did summon me for a rousing guys' night.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_You do seem to be turning a shade of, orange!
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_You don't mean.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_You heard him, Strike the new stuff!
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_You know what else is adorable?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_You mean a rowdy evening of reckless revelry?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_You read my mind.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_You really do make the best finger foods.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_You really had to be there.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_You remembered to cut off the crusts for me.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_You see, we were all at sweet apple acres.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_You think i don't have other friends?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_You weren't coming up with a plan just now, were you?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_You will be letting me stay at your place until i'm all better, wont you?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_You!
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_You'll get them back in good time.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_You're right, spike. it is a big deal.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_You've got to show everypony that you're too cool to be bothered with so called love. observe.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_You, trouble? never! i insist.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_ah no no no no. you didn't need the elements the last time you defeated sombra.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_although fluttershy should get most of the credit for that.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_and You say doomed? or, you say, rescue and i say.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_and i'm not sure using them still counts as handling things on your own.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_and parlay that confidence boost into being the best protectors of equestria you can be.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_anyway as i was saying, i pretended to be very hurt to convince you.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_but.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_every single detail of our previous encounter.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_fellow rescuers?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_hats, ladies?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_how was i supposed to know for sure that i'm truly still friends.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_i was betting on you, and i do hate being wrong.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_it's rather short.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_just to be clear, i was really rooting for you to do this on your own.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_ladies, ladies! i'm innocent! would i lie to you?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_mean to say is, that thing is a dear dear friend, And i'll make sure that the ooze that He can't help but secrete doesn't get on anypony else.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_moi? oh i couldn't possibly.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_oh That's not good enough for fluttershy. Should i make them fly?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_oh my, no elements? no princesses? seems like you're in a bit of a pickle.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_oh, Why should i try to explain it when you can see for yourself?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_oh, twilight. could this mean that you finally have the confidence, to ascend to the throne like the princesses believe you can?
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_or not.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_or the game is over.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_simply cannot Be recreated so that others might share in the experience.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_so what you're saying is, no tea? oh well, that's fine.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_sombra's back, and he's taking over the crystal empire.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_sure thing, but if you're going to be the ruler of equestria, you may want to work on your penmanship.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_that you didn't need anything but yourself to be the incredible leader i know you can be.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_well i was going to hang these up all over the castle to celebrate your coronation, but apparently, it's a bit premature.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_well, i guess it's on me to be the mvp today.
Discord_Neutral_Noisy_you want to head north, turn left.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_A dance contest?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_A little bit more.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_A little to the left!
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Actually, i was going to say a couple of those illusions Were slightly above average.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Alas, it seems, the tree have enough magic To keep the seeds from growing up big and strong.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_And at such peril.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_And captured princess celestia and princess luna thousands of moons ago.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_And i clearly meant for us to be there and not here.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_And that's why i need the best tea set.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_And yours is the most powerful and elusive element, magic.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Are you ready to enter the world of ogres and obliettes?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Are you sure this isn't overdoing?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Beautiful, isn't it?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Because that's how crazy we are when we're together!
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Boo!
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_But i wouldn't want to overstep my bounds.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_But i'm happy to pitch in if you need me.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_But seriously, this isn't the toughest crowd i've ever been in front of, But it's definitely the easiest to bug.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_But you are obviously, not fluttershy.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_By the time i got there i'd be too weak to even attempt to retrieve the flower.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Bye bye, have a nice time!
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Carry on.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Catch you later, twilight.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Certainly we can all agree that princess twilight Learned a valuable lesson here.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Chamomile, earl gray, green, white, yellow, maté, lemon, ginger, chai, spearmint, peppermint, hibiscus.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Chaos.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Check check, check! is this thing on?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Come now, Twilight Sparkle, you've got to get into the spirit of things.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Come skating with me, and we'll let bygones be bygones.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Enjoy your all expense paid trip around equestria.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Everypony has to play,.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Fine, i'll tell you, but i'll only tell you my way.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Fine. but i don't do windows.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Fluttershy's is kindness, And pinkie pie's is a personal favorite of mine, laughter.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Fluttershy, tell the hugs here about the time That we went to the store and came back with two cakes instead of one.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Fluttershy, there you are.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_From now on, i won't try to help.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Garbunkle, follow my lead!
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Get to know each other, why don't you?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Give me that.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Go on i'm listening.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_He does have a yen for shiny things, the rascal.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Headmare starlight! look at me, look!
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Hello, changelings and changelettes, believe me I was just as surprised as you are that i'm here.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_How about we have the tea party tomorrow afternoon?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Hungry?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_I always knew that you were the understanding one.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_I am so glad that you are back from your trip, fluttershy.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_I ask that you never use your element of harmony against me.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_I can smell this set up a mile away.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_I don't suppose you brought any throne destroying tools along with these useless side show props?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_I got a month's supply for the teacher's lounge.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_I have a fluttershy to save!
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_I have done nothing of the sort!
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_I have no idea.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_I haven't walked that far in a millennia.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_I mean okay, the humidity isn't great, But where isn't that the case these days?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_I mean, it's not like you're going to stop the changelings by pulling a rabbit out of the hat.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_I missed you.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_I need attention. i need some care. i need.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_I said, orange you glad i've changed?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_I should go. i have a lot of, Other friends, i need to see tonight.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_I simply can't do it justice.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_I suppose you all know that i've been tasked to capture a certain escapee!
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_I thought you'd find this, hiss terical!
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_I was just wondering, could i trouble you for just one more thing?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_I was talking about the smooze!
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_I won the spellvenger hunt!
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'll be fine here on my own.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'll take it.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm missing some excellent chaos here.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm reformed, don't you remember?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm sorry to interrupt, but i just noticed something.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm sorry to say that i'm sick.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm sorry, do you validate?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_I've known smooze face for ages. He's not agitated, he's partying down, yo!
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_If i'm the worst, then why did you invite me?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_In case you haven't noticed, i was in the middle of a particularly invigorating shower.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Inadequate hoof and claw washing.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Indeed.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Is this thing on?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Isn't helping something that friends do for friends?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Isn't it though? And to think, it would never have happened Had i come to the gala as somepony else's plus one.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_It has nothing to do with seeing you or not seeing you. You can rest assured of that.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_It's quite lonely being encased in stone, But you wouldn't know that, would you, Because i don't turn ponies into stone.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_It's really quite boring.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Just stay out here until i come for you.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Just your presence here is making me feel so much better.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Let me show you a real guys' night.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Looks like i'll see you at the gala after all, fluttershy.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_May i take your.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Mine? i thought you were in charge here.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_My ears were burning.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_My plunder seeds should've stolen the magic from the tree of harmony.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_No, my left!
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_No? nothing?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Not exactly great and powerful, but effective.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Now what's my prize?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Odd. i was trying to take us right to fluttershy But, there is no fluttershy.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh but we must, it's for the greater good!
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh this looks like.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh well, if at first you don't succeed.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, charming, thank you.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, did i say that out i mean, ta ta!
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, fluttershy. i didn't see you there.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, he's not that bad!
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, i was wondering when you were going to ask me! i'd love to.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, i'd better take this.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, i'm absolutely certain she does.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, no, no, no no, on the More right!
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, not a what, but a who, dear.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, oh oh, i'm learning so much, aren't you?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, oh! it looks like somepony wants to mingle, We'll be back in a bit.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, over there. somewhere. just go over there.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, really?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, right, whatever.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, so boring, celestia, really.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, this is so strange. we're here and that's there.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, yes. awful business, that.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, you mean like trapping best friend ponies In hedge mazes, and turning them against each other.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, you must be rainbow dash, famed for her loyalty, The element of harmony you represent.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, you're so sweet to offer.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, you're talking about me, i presume.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh. What's this?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_On the hill at the very edge of equestria, there grows an exquisite magic flower.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Or perhaps these things just take time.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Orange! like the lunch at the applejack farm!
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Pick the flower as it drops its petals at sunset.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Picture it.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Please, do come in.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Ponyville's not going to paint itself red.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Relax! i'm not going to hurt you, I'm simply going to send you to another dimension!
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Seems i possess a magic that gives me quite an important role in equestria.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Shall i continue?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_She told me about it, in her last letter.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Shining armor, why whatever are you doing here?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Sir mcbiggun, i'd cover the entrance if i were you.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Slipped my mind.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Smooze! i would like you to meet fluttershy and.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Smoozeface, the smoozinator.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_So, i'm able to rip the very fabric of reality again.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_That's all very nice, but really a waste of time. We have me.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_The beautiful rarity, Representing the element of generosity, if i'm not mistaken.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_The best table magic can buy.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_The rest of you could learn a lot about friendship from my dear friend shutterfly here.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Then we can have a good laugh, About this whole affair, over our regular tuesday tea.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Then you can make a magical soothing elixir to cure the blue flu.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_There is one last variable that we haven't accounted for.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_There is one way.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_This is the new and improved Ponyville.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_This is what guys' night is all about. am i right, fellas?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_This seems like one of those moments where we need a plan.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_This way! we're almost there!
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Time to call in the team.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_To bug.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_To retrieve your missing elements, Just make sense of this change of events.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_To take care of me, has made me feel better already.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Twilight said so herself.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Twilight! this makes twice i'm seeing you in one day!
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Twists and turns are my master plan.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Twists and turns, are my master plan, Then find the elements back where you began.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Ugh, i don't know how any of you manage not being able To disappear and reappear whenever you want.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Unless of course, you're really saying that you are not my friend.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Until now, that is.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Very close.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Welcome to your lucky day, rarity.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well i'm glad you got that, because that's what is true.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well that's what i thought. i was being sarcastic before.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, done me!
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, i was in my thinking tree, that's where i do most of my really deep thinking.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, i'll need all my energy when i'm dancing at the gala, If i decide to go that is, oh by the way, are you bringing anypony?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, it's decent chaos, i don't know if i'd call it total.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, perhaps we should have another look At the data that we've collected.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, seems this has become quite the, sticky situation!
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, that's disappointing.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, then lucky for you we're here.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_What a fascinating read. haven't you girls just learned so much?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_What do you think? you like?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_What's the matter, pinkie pie?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_What? i was simply going to ask for a, teeny tiny glass, of water.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_When i heard that i'd be playing for a bunch of changelings, i was beside myself.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_When she singles you out as the one who could reform me.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Why not thick air? what's the deal there?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Why the angry eyes? you love passing tests.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Why, stretching of course.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_With you, fluttershy.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Won't twilight be so disappointed With how you're ruining, i mean running her school?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Yes, twilight sparkle.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_You can take them and leave the game, Or you can carry on, aimlessly wandering this maze.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_You certainly are, And i should probably help you get free.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_You did.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_You found the one thing in equestria That could rival my face for sheer beauty.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_You have to knock this tea party out of the park for her.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_You know whenever ponies talk about powerful magic, They always leave me out.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_You know, i think princess celestia is right.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_You know, it would be much easier if i took you there myself.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_You said to make myself at home while you were gone.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_You should really consider taking it on the road.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_You're off to such a good start i'm seriously considering actually Being reformed.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_You're talking about me, i presume?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Your choice.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Your friends laugh at you all the time.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_Your name's slipping my mind right now.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_although if you think about it, i am your friend so maybe you win because friendship wins?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_and these are only my first changes.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_are we sure that i'll get my magic back When we destroy this throne thingy?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_aren't games fun?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_discord, your friend twilight, says that she is your pal.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_how to rule equestria by nopony mcpretendsmith.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_it was this table here.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_make sense? Oh, what fun is there in making sense?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_oh no no no no no. you were absolutely right, you need to learn how to handle these things on your own.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_oh, I never dream of such things.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_oh, Well, it does, very much so.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_oh, Well, that's a bit harsh isn't it?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_or are you in, more of a jam?
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_ta-tah.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_then find the Elements back where you began.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_then i realized it was just one of you.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_this looks like it says, cadance sent an emergency message.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_ugh. fine.
Discord_Neutral_Very Noisy_well Of course you'd say that, It just goes to show how understanding you truly are.
Discord_Neutral__A barrage of arrows rains down on you.
Discord_Neutral__A guys night?
Discord_Neutral__A well intentioned lie.
Discord_Neutral__All my chaos magic is, gone.
Discord_Neutral__All the confidence you gained. Remember the cheering?
Discord_Neutral__All those years apart before being reunited.
Discord_Neutral__All very well intentioned and noble on my part.
Discord_Neutral__Allow me.
Discord_Neutral__And did you know that Octavia went on a date with Bulk Biceps?
Discord_Neutral__And let me tell you he can cause plenty of chaos all on his purple lonesome.
Discord_Neutral__Anyway, since we're in the neighborhood.
Discord_Neutral__Apples are terrible at taking directions.
Discord_Neutral__As i previously mentioned.
Discord_Neutral__As the Lord of Chaos, I'd advise against saying things like.
Discord_Neutral__As the Lord of Chaos, I'd advise against saying things like.
Discord_Neutral__Ask princess luna.
Discord_Neutral__Better?
Discord_Neutral__But funny how you remembered it that way Anyway, good to see you.
Discord_Neutral__But now i see that we should have.
Discord_Neutral__But she never writes, and she never pops in for a visit.
Discord_Neutral__But the weather today is particularly nice.
Discord_Neutral__But we're pals, right? Comrades. Amigos.
Discord_Neutral__But you'd have to ask nicely, and spare my friends.
Discord_Neutral__Chrysalis, Tirek, and Cozy Glow now have all of the real Grogar's magic.
Discord_Neutral__Class is now in session.
Discord_Neutral__Compared to me losing my powers, anything else is good news.
Discord_Neutral__Couldn't even manage to stay in one location.
Discord_Neutral__Couldn't i just, come with you instead?
Discord_Neutral__Dismissed!
Discord_Neutral__Do something chaotic?
Discord_Neutral__Don't be such a drama dragon. I've precipitated liquid cocoa on Equestria.
Discord_Neutral__Don't forget Sombra.
Discord_Neutral__Don't look at me!
Discord_Neutral__Each of you has a job to do! Take a look at your stems!
Discord_Neutral__Eat what?
Discord_Neutral__Everypony is always asking you to move a couch or help with a proposal.
Discord_Neutral__Everything is finally perfect, for fluttershy.
Discord_Neutral__Farewell, garbunkle the magician.
Discord_Neutral__Find it, you'll know what to do.
Discord_Neutral__Fine! we'll play your game.
Discord_Neutral__Fine. You owe me for this.
Discord_Neutral__First of all, we need to get rid of all the new stuff.

Discord_Neutral__How embarrassing.
Discord_Neutral__Huh!
Discord_Neutral__Huh? huh?
Discord_Neutral__I am famished. i'll take all the cakes.
Discord_Neutral__I can't stop sneezing and wheezing.
Discord_Neutral__I certainly won't tell you, after the way you lied to me last time we teamed up.
Discord_Neutral__I could always tell you how.
Discord_Neutral__I do! who wants to be tethered to the ground, When you can do this?
Discord_Neutral__I don't know about that, mistakes happen.
Discord_Neutral__I hear puerto caballo is lovely this time of year.
Discord_Neutral__I intended to prepare Twilight for anything, by orchestrating an epic attack at her coronation.
Discord_Neutral__I keep tons of secrets, Like Fluttershy's secret fear of clowns.
Discord_Neutral__I mean normal.
Discord_Neutral__I mean schmarity.
Discord_Neutral__I never said they were in the labyrinth.
Discord_Neutral__I never thought of that!
Discord_Neutral__I really think we need a new code word.
Discord_Neutral__I ruined your night, and you don't even think i'm cool?
Discord_Neutral__I sent them back to Sweet Apple Acres.
Discord_Neutral__I spent the whole evening thinking about my own feelings.
Discord_Neutral__I stick my head through the bars and demand For the immediate release of the lord of chaos.
Discord_Neutral__I'll be enjoying her company tomorrow, so i will be needing your very best tea, please.
Discord_Neutral__I'll have to come back with some new material After i rescue fluttershy.
Discord_Neutral__I'll simply make them.
Discord_Neutral__I'm helping our friend, first and foremost.
Discord_Neutral__I'm hosting a tea party for her, and it has to be perfect.
Discord_Neutral__I'm listening.
Discord_Neutral__I'm sorry for ruining your game, And i'm sorry that i thought i was better than you.
Discord_Neutral__I'm sure i'd have fun.
Discord_Neutral__I'm sure that they were placed properly.
Discord_Neutral__I've gotten you both sick.
Discord_Neutral__I-i think. Maybe. Does it matter?
Discord_Neutral__If only i weren't super busy this evening.
Discord_Neutral__If only your pony friends could be as considerate.
Discord_Neutral__If you roll a fifteen or higher The shield protects you.
Discord_Neutral__It did rain the other day, however.
Discord_Neutral__It is so rare that those two get to see one another.
Discord_Neutral__It is very nice to see you today.
Discord_Neutral__It really is a curse having infinite powers.
Discord_Neutral__It would give you power over all reality.
Discord_Neutral__It's for fluttershy.
Discord_Neutral__It's high time i do something about it.
Discord_Neutral__Its schedule was free.
Discord_Neutral__June, honey? be a dear, reschedule luna and cay cay?
Discord_Neutral__Just think, after defeating three baddies, Twilight would have to believe.
Discord_Neutral__Lesson two, plenty of ponies in the pasture.
Discord_Neutral__Listen up!
Discord_Neutral__Look what a great job you did defeating Sombra.
Discord_Neutral__Make them.
Discord_Neutral__May I help? Please?

Discord_Neutral__No more holes though.
Discord_Neutral__No, it has to be even better than perfect!
Discord_Neutral__No. i actually never said that.
Discord_Neutral__Nopony was at your desk.
Discord_Neutral__Nothing. I thought we were just saying each other's names.
Discord_Neutral__Nothing. I thought we were just saying each other's names.
Discord_Neutral__Now bananas.
Discord_Neutral__Now why in the world would i ever try to do a thing like that?
Discord_Neutral__Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some chaos to wreak.
Discord_Neutral__Of course they were!
Discord_Neutral__Oh ha ha, oh you mean in the game.
Discord_Neutral__Oh well, i know what to do.
Discord_Neutral__Oh yes. thank you fluttershy for your concern.
Discord_Neutral__Oh, all right.
Discord_Neutral__Oh, back so soon?
Discord_Neutral__Oh, how kind of you to notice. it's the little details that really bring Alternate dimensions to life, wouldn't you say?
Discord_Neutral__Oh, i never realized how much work you put into hosting these tea parties.
Discord_Neutral__Oh, i should probably have said something.
Discord_Neutral__Oh, now where was i?
Discord_Neutral__Oh, twilight's friend And applejack's monosyllabic brother.
Discord_Neutral__Oh, we were.
Discord_Neutral__Oh. All right. Point taken.
Discord_Neutral__Oh. well you kind of left out all the fun and frivolity there, But i'm sure you got it tree hugger.
Discord_Neutral__Okay, but to be fair, the message did get to Sugar Belle.
Discord_Neutral__Oops.
Discord_Neutral__Or that time I caught Twilight sleep trotting through town.
Discord_Neutral__Perhaps maybe I should.
Discord_Neutral__Perhaps we haven't met.
Discord_Neutral__Please do come in.
Discord_Neutral__Please, can't you see that that holiday is a commercialized ruse?
Discord_Neutral__Please, have a seat.
Discord_Neutral__Red, delicious, sweet like you.
Discord_Neutral__Regardless of what Spike might say, that little dragon begged me to help.
Discord_Neutral__Right, big mac?
Discord_Neutral__She gave us a chance when no other pony would.
Discord_Neutral__So why don't you two, you know?
Discord_Neutral__So, all this is just tea you simply drink?
Discord_Neutral__So, shall we hop to it?
Discord_Neutral__Sort of a one pony theatre piece if you will.
Discord_Neutral__Sounds like somepony needs a little motivation.
Discord_Neutral__Spike, she's an imaginary one dimensional paper cut out skeleton.
Discord_Neutral__Spirit of chaos and disharmony.
Discord_Neutral__Surely you saw this coming?
Discord_Neutral__Talk about an odd couple. I heard that.
Discord_Neutral__Technically.
Discord_Neutral__Tell me about it. But regardless, go to your designated location.
Discord_Neutral__Thank you.
Discord_Neutral__That even she can have feelings of jealousy,.
Discord_Neutral__That she should recognize said feelings Rather than trying to pretend that she doesn't have them.
Discord_Neutral__That's just the first of many cheese jokes If we go down this path.
Discord_Neutral__That's what i call princess celestia. what a hoot.
Discord_Neutral__That's your cue!
Discord_Neutral__The hoof bumps?
Discord_Neutral__The secret is in the extra butter.
Discord_Neutral__They're positively delectable.
Discord_Neutral__This can't be. i'm supposed to feel sorry for you Because i'm me, and you're you.
Discord_Neutral__This is just me, being me.
Discord_Neutral__This smells, uh, palatable.
Discord_Neutral__This spell here. i transform him into a parsnip.
Discord_Neutral__This whole story is being twisted to make it seem like it was all my fault.
Discord_Neutral__Those are very bad cards.
Discord_Neutral__Those terrible riddles on the apples were very clear on the location.
Discord_Neutral__Tonight is guys' night.
Discord_Neutral__Tonight will be the best night of your lives.
Discord_Neutral__Trapped in Grogar's Bell.
Discord_Neutral__Unless.
Discord_Neutral__We could have been roomies.
Discord_Neutral__Well it seemed like a good idea at the time.
Discord_Neutral__Well let me try and paint her a picture, dearest.
Discord_Neutral__Well, it looks like i know where i'll be crashing.
Discord_Neutral__Well, not yet.
Discord_Neutral__What do you say?
Discord_Neutral__What ever do you mean?
Discord_Neutral__What is it? I want to see!
Discord_Neutral__What particularly nice weather we're having.
Discord_Neutral__When you see a guy leaning against a thing looking this cool, you think wow, that guy doesn't have a care in equestria.
Discord_Neutral__Which is what I knew all along.
Discord_Neutral__Which is why I also brought back three other villains who are now on the loose and not really big fans of yours.
Discord_Neutral__Who are you proposing to?
Discord_Neutral__Who do you think broke sugar belle's wagon wheel?
Discord_Neutral__Whom ever shall i turn to now, in my time of need?
Discord_Neutral__Why does everypony immediately assume that this has something to do with me?
Discord_Neutral__Why, thank you for noticing.
Discord_Neutral__Wish i could stay and chat but, i don't want to.
Discord_Neutral__With one of the most important ponies around?
Discord_Neutral__Would you care for some milk toast?
Discord_Neutral__Would you like the good news or the bad news?
Discord_Neutral__Yes i have it right here.
Discord_Neutral__Yes, actually. And I have a confession to make.
Discord_Neutral__Yes, but you all expect that of me.
Discord_Neutral__Yes, she is a real sweetheart. we are all so lucky to have her in our lives.
Discord_Neutral__Yes, so many other friends.
Discord_Neutral__You aren't kidding.
Discord_Neutral__You could say it was.
Discord_Neutral__You don't remember me?
Discord_Neutral__You don't take a final exam on your first day of class.
Discord_Neutral__You have met me before actually!
Discord_Neutral__You know if she's too busy to read the horribly written clues.
Discord_Neutral__You know, thinking back, I probably could have been clearer which pony to deliver the messages to.
Discord_Neutral__You need a giant rhino named Dolores, who can knit a romantic sweater for two.
Discord_Neutral__You should both be very disappointed in yourselves.
Discord_Neutral__You weren't there observing us.
Discord_Neutral__You're welcome!
Discord_Neutral__You're welcome.
Discord_Neutral__Your garden looks positively lovely.
Discord_Neutral__Your wish, is my command!
Discord_Neutral__Zoot suits, fedoras, swing dancing?
Discord_Neutral__and not seeing the poems is actually a blessing when you think about it.
Discord_Neutral__and then applejack said.
Discord_Neutral__are much better at listening.
Discord_Neutral__deliver your messages and make me proud!
Discord_Neutral__i need your advice.
Discord_Neutral__maybe you should just tell her.
Discord_Neutral__that she's the leader we all know she is!
Discord_Neutral__we don't have to wonder.
Discord_Neutral__you find yourself on a battlefield.
Discord_Sad Anxious_Noisy_Because, you and i, don't make sense to anypony else.
Discord_Sad Anxious__I was afraid that if you saw exactly how different we are, You wouldn't want to be friends anymore.
Discord_Sad Sarcastic_Noisy_Ah! some thanks for all my help.
Discord_Sad Sarcastic_Noisy_You've broken my trust and failed me completely.
Discord_Sad Whispering_Noisy_and rainbow dash will be loyal as can be.
Discord_Sad Whispering_Noisy_and twilight, you are and always will be the embodiment of magic.
Discord_Sad Whispering_Noisy_because that's who you are.
Discord_Sad Whispering_Noisy_nothing, and no pony can ever take that away from you.
Discord_Sad Whispering_Noisy_pinkie will always bring laughter wherever she goes.
Discord_Sad Whispering_Noisy_you lost sight of what's in front of you. you're here, together, willing to give everything you've got for equestria.
Discord_Sad_Noisy_A gift from someone close to you.
Discord_Sad_Noisy_And after i hired all those substitute teachers for you.
Discord_Sad_Noisy_And here i thought we were friends.
Discord_Sad_Noisy_Because this condition has left me helpless, simply helpless.
Discord_Sad_Noisy_But all i did was make it chaotic and weird, like me.
Discord_Sad_Noisy_But there's nothing worth more, i see that now.
Discord_Sad_Noisy_I didn't!
Discord_Sad_Noisy_I hate goodbyes, don't you?
Discord_Sad_Noisy_I just go to pieces.
Discord_Sad_Noisy_I know.
Discord_Sad_Noisy_I'm just so new with this whole friendship thing.
Discord_Sad_Noisy_Oh, i feel just terrible.
Discord_Sad_Noisy_Oh, oh oh dear, it looks like i've perhaps overreacted just a skosh.
Discord_Sad_Noisy_Ooh poo! i just ordered business cards!
Discord_Sad_Noisy_This was the sign of your gratitude and loyalty!
Discord_Sad_Noisy_Well played, fluttershy.
Discord_Sad_Noisy_Why i can barely lift a spoon.
Discord_Sad_Very Noisy_And now, i don't have either.
Discord_Sad_Very Noisy_But taking in the sick and the desperate, isn't that what fluttershy would do?
Discord_Sad_Very Noisy_I had magic and friendship.
Discord_Sad_Very Noisy_I liked it better my way but, i guess when you're friends You, can't always have things exactly your way all the time.
Discord_Sad_Very Noisy_I suppose this is goodbye then.
Discord_Sad_Very Noisy_I was reformed by lovely little.
Discord_Sad_Very Noisy_I'll do whatever you say, because.
Discord_Sad_Very Noisy_It's just such a shame that today of all days, is when i really need her.
Discord_Sad_Very Noisy_Oh but you are, fluttershy.
Discord_Sad_Very Noisy_Oh rainbow dash, i've changed, surely you remember.
Discord_Sad_Very Noisy_The stare? oh no, please, not that!
Discord_Sad_Very Noisy_Well played.
Discord_Sad_Very Noisy_You are the pony who tought me that friendship is magic.
Discord_Sad_Very Noisy_what's wrong, pal?
Discord_Sad__Anything but your disapproving eyeballs!
Discord_Sad__But you said.
Discord_Sad__I truly did have the best intentions. I swear I'll make it up to you.
Discord_Sad__I truly didn't!
Discord_Sad__I'm so sorry.
Discord_Sad__It made so much sense in my head.
Discord_Sad__Oh. well i've, never really had a friend before.
Discord_Sad__Twilight defeats her worst enemies, and is filled with confidence.
Discord_Sad__oh.
Discord_Sad__oh.
Discord_Sarcastic Annoyed_Noisy_It's not, as if any of this actually mattered!
Discord_Sarcastic_Noisy_And i want to hang out with spike and big mac!
Discord_Sarcastic_Noisy_Curse myself for attending this infernal evening?
Discord_Sarcastic_Noisy_Does somepony need a huggy wuggy?
Discord_Sarcastic_Noisy_How nice for you.
Discord_Sarcastic_Noisy_How terrifying!
Discord_Sarcastic_Noisy_I suppose i could, but after all the hoof pointing, And besmearching my good name i just don't know if i'm up to it!
Discord_Sarcastic_Noisy_Made it so that there was no time for you two to focus on your friendship?
Discord_Sarcastic_Noisy_Oh! how could you starlight?
Discord_Sarcastic_Noisy_Oops, sorry.
Discord_Sarcastic_Noisy_Oopsie doopsie.
Discord_Sarcastic_Noisy_Oopsie.
Discord_Sarcastic_Noisy_Well, how silly of me to assume that you'd think that.
Discord_Sarcastic_Noisy_Well, that's some way to treat a suffering friend.
Discord_Sarcastic_Noisy_What's that?
Discord_Sarcastic_Noisy_While i'm being reformed.
Discord_Sarcastic_Noisy_countless adversities. yeah, yeah, we get it.
Discord_Sarcastic_Noisy_hello-o.
Discord_Sarcastic_Noisy_that they're having without you.
Discord_Sarcastic_Noisy_woe is me. will i ever learn the intricate nuances of being a good friend?
Discord_Sarcastic_Very Noisy_All you did was chose to keep your precious, princess self Out of harm's way, while your friends thrust themselves wide into it.
Discord_Sarcastic_Very Noisy_And here i thought laughter made you happy.
Discord_Sarcastic_Very Noisy_Because if i don't i'll lose the one friend i ever had?
Discord_Sarcastic_Very Noisy_Fire when ready.
Discord_Sarcastic_Very Noisy_I can make more new friends anytime i want.
Discord_Sarcastic_Very Noisy_I insist.
Discord_Sarcastic_Very Noisy_I'm sure you'll all be the best of pals again, when they return from their terrifying yet deeply bonding experience.
Discord_Sarcastic_Very Noisy_No, no, here. take my plus one.
Discord_Sarcastic_Very Noisy_Not a problem!
Discord_Sarcastic_Very Noisy_Oh, poor pinkie pie.
Discord_Sarcastic_Very Noisy_Well, that's reassuring.
Discord_Sarcastic_Very Noisy_Why don't you ask your zebra friend if she knows anything?
Discord_Sarcastic_Very Noisy_Why don't you ask your zebra friend?
Discord_Sarcastic_Very Noisy_You're so very kind, my dear fluttershy.
Discord_Sarcastic_Very Noisy_You're worried discord might be upset?
Discord_Sarcastic_Very Noisy_and now it's time to meet my fate.
Discord_Sarcastic_Very Noisy_we're friends.
Discord_Sarcastic__Because it's time to destroy Equestria.
Discord_Sarcastic__Besides, we have plans.
Discord_Sarcastic__Have I mentioned how great revenge is?
Discord_Sarcastic__I hope you got a name picked out for your future kingdom.
Discord_Sarcastic__I'm prepared to be defeated now, ladies.
Discord_Sarcastic__Just like in real life.
Discord_Sarcastic__Let the fool go. Without magic, he's no threat.
Discord_Sarcastic__Really, you describe things, and then we pretend it's real.
Discord_Sarcastic__The Lame Six are so busy being perfect.
Discord_Sarcastic__What? look at me! i'm practically reformed already.
Discord_Sarcastic__Who, me?
Discord_Sarcastic__they haven't even noticed what we've been up to.
Discord_Shouting_Very Noisy_To the ends of equestria, to face such great danger.
Discord_Shouting_Very Noisy_We're not stopping!
Discord_Shouting_Very Noisy_like this!
Discord_Smug Sarcastic_Noisy_Maybe the magic of friendship can help you.
Discord_Smug Sarcastic__Oh you wouldn't dare turn me back to stone And risk disappointing your precious princess.
Discord_Smug_Noisy_At least my magic can do something.
Discord_Smug_Noisy_Discord rules, Celestia drools.
Discord_Smug_Noisy_Game's over, my little ponies.
Discord_Smug_Noisy_Harmony in Equestria is officially dead.
Discord_Smug_Noisy_I imagine they'll be your last decent meal for quite some time.
Discord_Smug_Noisy_I never thought you'd be the kind of pony who would think she was better than everypony else.
Discord_Smug_Noisy_I wouldn't be so sure.
Discord_Smug_Noisy_Isn't that what friends are for, taking care of each other?
Discord_Smug_Noisy_Oh, i doubt that.
Discord_Smug_Noisy_Oh, you realized how amazing i am, And that i make you cooler just by being around me?
Discord_Smug_Noisy_On the contrary, i think i rather can, and will.
Discord_Smug_Noisy_She can't use the elements against me because.
Discord_Smug_Noisy_She wants to have fun with me because we're friends.
Discord_Smug_Noisy_Ta ta!
Discord_Smug_Noisy_Unless you don't think you're good enough to teach me.
Discord_Smug_Noisy_You're right, she did surprise him.
Discord_Smug_Noisy_i see what you're doing.
Discord_Smug_Noisy_well well well.
Discord_Smug_Noisy_while you'll still be A self absorbed, below average, illusionist.
Discord_Smug_Very Noisy_Bravo, ponies, bravo.
Discord_Smug_Very Noisy_But you see, unlike you i can do anything.
Discord_Smug_Very Noisy_Do go on.
Discord_Smug_Very Noisy_How d'ya like them carrots?
Discord_Smug_Very Noisy_I'm playing your owner for a fool!
Discord_Smug_Very Noisy_Looks like we might be due for a big ol' storm of chaos.
Discord_Smug_Very Noisy_Looks like we might be due for a big ol' storm of.
Discord_Smug_Very Noisy_Makes me wanna pinch your little horsey cheeks.
Discord_Smug_Very Noisy_Oh Applejack, don't lie to me. I'm the one who made you a liar.
Discord_Smug_Very Noisy_Oh, i doubt that.
Discord_Smug_Very Noisy_Oh, i know much more than that, honest applejack.
Discord_Smug_Very Noisy_Oh, i'd forgotten how grim you can be, celestia.
Discord_Smug_Very Noisy_Somepony broke the no wings, no magic rule.
Discord_Smug_Very Noisy_We'll see about that.
Discord_Smug_Very Noisy_Well, i just borrowed them for a teensy little while.
Discord_Smug_Very Noisy_What have you got there?
Discord_Smug_Very Noisy_Will you ever learn?
Discord_Smug_Very Noisy_You didn't find your precious elements.
Discord_Smug_Very Noisy_i only ask one thing in return.
Discord_Smug_Very Noisy_no luck finding your tree?
Discord_Smug__And not just because you get to bask in my greatness.
Discord_Smug__How about pathetic centaur, who uses magic to compensate for the fact that deep down.
Discord_Smug__I already have the best name in the universe. Why would i change it for something like captain wuzz?
Discord_Smug__I can't think of anything that they would want less!
Discord_Smug__Keep trying, Twilight Sparkle.
Discord_Smug__Oh so, I'm not the only one who messes things up am I, Mister High and Mighty Dragon?
Discord_Smug__Soon there won't be a pegasus, earth pony or unicorn Who will be able to stand up against us.
Discord_Smug__Together forever.
Discord_Smug__Well, we've all made up, and we're here for a do over. And this time, thanks to me, we've got it right.
Discord_Smug__Well, well, well. I see you found the Elements of Harmony.
Discord_Smug__Who cares?
Discord_Smug__You just had an extremely good looking safety net.
Discord_Smug__You ponies truly believe that you can reform me.
Discord_Smug__You're right. Cretin is too polite.
Discord_Smug__and I win.
Discord_Smug__he's afraid he'll never be enough to please dear old dad, King Vorak?

Double Diamond_Anxious_Noisy_Trouble?
Double Diamond_Anxious_Very Noisy_But if twilight sparkle becomes our friend, then why do we care about this old cutiemark?
Double Diamond_Anxious_Very Noisy_Fluttershy is one of us now.
Double Diamond_Anxious_Very Noisy_Surely she can be trusted.
Double Diamond_Anxious_Very Noisy_We'll never find her in there!

Dr. Caballeron_Smug_Very Noisy_For you, have led us directly to the lost temple, of chicomoztoc!
Dr. Caballeron_Smug_Very Noisy_So the amulet, is as good as mine.

Dr. Hooves_Neutral_Noisy_Gentlecolts!
Dr. Hooves_Neutral_Noisy_I never could quite figure out how to get them to ignite.
Dr. Hooves_Neutral_Noisy_I'm sorry gentlecolts, but i will not bowl.
Dr. Hooves_Neutral_Noisy_I've been studying science my whole life.
Dr. Hooves_Neutral_Noisy_My word, is that a bugbear?
Dr. Hooves_Neutral_Noisy_Rarity? rarity!
Dr. Hooves_Neutral_Noisy_Science provides explanations of things we never thought possible!
Dr. Hooves_Neutral_Noisy_The splits, the spares!
Dr. Hooves_Neutral_Noisy_Turns out there's a magic spell for it.
Dr. Hooves_Neutral_Noisy_Very well. i'll try your, straight technique.
Dr. Hooves_Neutral_Noisy_Who knew?
Dr. Hooves_Neutral_Very Noisy_But, there are so many things that magic can't explain, Where science and mathematics are the real magic!
Dr. Hooves_Neutral_Very Noisy_Going back in time is old thinking, my friend.
Dr. Hooves_Neutral_Very Noisy_I was working off a cutting edge theory Of making time come forward to you.

Dr. Hooves_Surprised_Very Noisy_Great whickering stallions, they've got style!

Dragon Lord Torch_Annoyed_Noisy_Where do you think you're going, little dragon?
Dragon Lord Torch_Annoyed_Noisy_Where do you think you're going?
Dragon Lord Torch_Annoyed_Noisy_You don't get to leave unless i say you can.

Dragon Lord Torch_Annoyed_Very Noisy_When i want you to laugh i will say, be amused!
Dragon Lord Torch_Confused Annoyed__What is the meaning of this?
Dragon Lord Torch_Neutral_Noisy_All dragons are welcome to compete,.
Dragon Lord Torch_Neutral_Noisy_And my reign has been extraordinary.
Dragon Lord Torch_Neutral_Noisy_And perhaps that counts for more than i thought.
Dragon Lord Torch_Neutral_Noisy_Because it takes a big strong dragon, to lead.
Dragon Lord Torch_Neutral_Noisy_Flying to flamecano island, is the first of many challenges you will face, in your quest to find, the bloodstone scepter!
Dragon Lord Torch_Neutral_Noisy_From the heart of the flamecano.
Dragon Lord Torch_Neutral_Noisy_I thought i released you, tiny one.

Dragon Lord Torch_Neutral_Noisy_Only dragons with my ferocity, strength and determination.
Dragon Lord Torch_Neutral_Noisy_The gauntlet is dangerous, for i designed it myself.
Dragon Lord Torch_Neutral_Noisy_To compete for the throne, in the gauntlet of fire!
Dragon Lord Torch_Neutral_Noisy_To retrieve this bloodstone scepter.
Dragon Lord Torch_Neutral_Noisy_We will gather at the cliff, when the sun is at its peak!
Dragon Lord Torch_Neutral_Noisy_Whomever has the strength and fortitude.
Dragon Lord Torch_Neutral_Noisy_Will be able to finish.
Dragon Lord Torch_Neutral_Noisy_Will be crowned, lord of the dragons!

Dragon Lord Torch_Neutral_Very Noisy_Besides, i said no!
Dragon Lord Torch_Neutral_Very Noisy_This is why i have summoned you.
Dragon Lord Torch_Neutral__And you will make, an excellent leader.
Dragon Lord Torch_Neutral__For they do so at their own peril.
Dragon Lord Torch_Neutral__That wasn't a joke it was a fact.
Dragon Lord Torch_Neutral__Unfortunately, according to dragon law, It is time for me to step down. sad, i know.
Dragon Lord Torch_Neutral__Very well, little dragon. i release you.
Dragon Lord Torch_Shouting_Noisy_Dragons of equestria! hear me!

Dragon Lord Torch_Shouting_Very Noisy_Be sad!
Dragon Lord Torch_Surprised Confused_Noisy_Ember? you!?
Ember_Amused_Noisy_Just kidding. that's not gonna be my thing.
Ember_Angry Shouting_Noisy_Put that rock back! immediately!
Ember_Angry Shouting_Very Noisy_Are you calling me a liar?
Ember_Angry_Noisy_I hate when he does that!
Ember_Angry_Noisy_I know i do.
Ember_Angry_Noisy_I'll show you unpredictable.
Ember_Angry_Noisy_Now they'll never hatch!
Ember_Angry_Noisy_They probably want to run away and bury themselves Under a rock and.
Ember_Angry_Noisy_Upset!
Ember_Angry_Noisy_Yeah? well my dragons will burn every kingdom Until we find which of you is hiding smolder!
Ember_Angry_Noisy_You back away! i'm not going to let you harm him!
Ember_Angry_Noisy_grr!
Ember_Angry_Noisy_mad.
Ember_Angry_Noisy_ugh, it's supposed to be heating the eggs!
Ember_Angry__Let me talk about this!
Ember_Annoyed Sarcastic_Noisy_You thought he wouldn't like me just because i'm a dragon And i'm bad at friendship?
Ember_Annoyed_Noisy_And i know i need to tell you how i feel Because my friend, thorax, said it would make me feel better.
Ember_Annoyed_Noisy_And it does!
Ember_Annoyed_Noisy_But, i'm smarter than most of these boulderheads And you know it.
Ember_Annoyed_Noisy_Grr! you! go and bring all the dragons to the hatching grounds. we'll have to make the heat ourselves.
Ember_Annoyed_Noisy_How long, have you been removing these boulders?
Ember_Annoyed_Noisy_I can say i'm bad at friendship, you can't say it about me!
Ember_Annoyed_Noisy_I don't care what my dad said!
Ember_Annoyed_Noisy_If you promise to stop singing, smolder can stay!
Ember_Annoyed_Noisy_Just so you know, this doesn't mean we're gonna pick flowers Or exchange necklaces or whatever pony friends do.
Ember_Annoyed_Noisy_Smolder? let's go.
Ember_Annoyed_Noisy_The hero of the dragonlands, that's who!
Ember_Annoyed_Noisy_These dragons, do!
Ember_Annoyed_Noisy_Uh of course! there's a lake of molten lava under them.
Ember_Annoyed_Noisy_What are you up to, shape shifter?
Ember_Annoyed_Noisy_Why are you still here?
Ember_Annoyed_Noisy_You know what? i don't want to talk about it.
Ember_Annoyed_Noisy_You're pretty quick to blame them. What are you hiding, yak?
Ember_Annoyed_Noisy_aw, fine!
Ember_Annoyed_Noisy_uhhh, again?
Ember_Annoyed_Very Noisy_What do you think you're doing?
Ember_Annoyed_Very Noisy_i'm not big and strong! i know! but you know what?
Ember_Annoyed__Because as dragon lord, i'm ordering you to be here!
Ember_Annoyed__Besides, who are you to be telling me about friendship?
Ember_Annoyed__But i'm right.
Ember_Annoyed__I'll show him, and everydragon who thinks I'm just a little princess.
Ember_Annoyed__I've barely seen you all day.
Ember_Annoyed__Maybe if we were in ponyland But, like i said, dragons don't do friendship.
Ember_Annoyed__There are better things than being big and strong!
Ember_Annoyed__which i don't because we were only helping each other Get through the tunnel.
Ember_Annoyed__your kind?
Ember_Anxious Confused_Noisy_How? you can't even get inside.
Ember_Anxious Confused_Noisy_Really? how?
Ember_Anxious Confused_Noisy_What is that?
Ember_Anxious_Noisy_But none of them have even cracked.
Ember_Anxious_Noisy_I don't know what else we can try!
Ember_Anxious_Noisy_I don't know. it's my first time being in charge.
Ember_Anxious_Noisy_I wish. they've been doing that for days.
Ember_Anxious_Noisy_I'm sure it means something, but it's probably not good.
Ember_Anxious_Noisy_I've ordered everydragon to warm up the eggs but they still won't hatch.
Ember_Anxious_Noisy_I.
Ember_Anxious_Noisy_Spike! get the scepter!
Ember_Anxious_Noisy_Spike, get away from the bear!
Ember_Anxious_Noisy_You know how fragile those things are? No way we'll be able to move them all safely.
Ember_Anxious_Noisy_not really. the eggs should have hatched by now.
Ember_Anxious__Are you sure about this?
Ember_Anxious__But that's what i'm doing.
Ember_Anxious__I never should have left you back there.
Ember_Anxious__I'm.
Ember_Anxious__Ugh, please don't make me talk about my feelings.
Ember_Anxious__Yikes. that looks rough.
Ember_Anxious__feel.
Ember_Confused_Noisy_And they're putting themselves in danger just to support you.
Ember_Confused_Noisy_Wait, did you say you're not going to let me harm spike?
Ember_Confused_Noisy_What? no. you're the dragon lord now.
Ember_Confused_Noisy_Why did you cover for me?
Ember_Confused_Noisy_Yeah, what?
Ember_Confused_Noisy_You're making weird noises.
Ember_Confused_Very Noisy_Wait, how did you two get through?
Ember_Confused__Did that seaweed just talk?
Ember_Confused__How is that different?
Ember_Confused__Wait, you're in charge?
Ember_Confused__What are you doing?
Ember_Confused__What are you talking about? you've been with me this whole time.
Ember_Confused__Why would we be fighting?
Ember_Disgust__Friends? dragons don't do friends.
Ember_Happy_Noisy_Hey, twilight.
Ember_Happy_Noisy_You ready to do some death defying dragon stuff?
Ember_Happy__Thanks, dad.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_Ahh, i get it.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_And if that doesn't work, turn into a bear.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_But, that's what makes it a challenge.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_Can you please tell these two i'm right?
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_Crushing another dragon in competition Establishes my dominance and makes me feel great!
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_Dad wasn't big on sharing dragonlord details it's, kind of a burn or be burned job.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_Dad, look at him! he's just a runt.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_Do you have a stomach ache?
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_Hello!
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_Ho boy, you need to be more assertive.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_Humiliated! ashamed!
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_I am ember, daughter of torch, winner of the gauntlet of fire And lord of all dragons!
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_I can't exactly learn about friendship If i don't make new friends.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_I don't want to talk about it.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_I feel like i'm being avoided.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_I know it is.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_I know where we can start.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_I know you didn't think i could do it, but i did.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_I know you have it in you.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_I mean, just until we get through that tunnel.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_I think i'm allergic to feelings.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_I think we go through there.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_I think you might be encouraging them to stay in.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_I thought this was an official friendship banquet.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_I won anyway. so, maybe it takes more than just being Big and strong to be a good dragon lord.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_I'm just saying, you're both purple ponies with purple hair.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_I'm sorry, but you can't blame me, You both look and act so much alike.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_I'm, really gonna have to get used to these pony names, Lots of lights and shiny things.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_I've thought about it and your plan makes sense. let's do it.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_Is this another part of pony friendship?
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_Make a decision and let it be known That the decision is final.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_Now if you don't mind, can you teach me How to write poetry like that? it's pretty cool.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_Now let's go!
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, good, spike.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, i get it.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_Ok right, more pony hugs.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_Right, the hug thing.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_Shh! stop talking.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_So this is something friends do?
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_So, i guess it's every dragon for themselves.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_So, yeah. i'm good.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_Telling each other what you learned all the time?
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_That's probably why.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_That's why the eggs are laid here.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_There's nothing to be unsure of.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_They look very similar.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_This place has a lot of colors.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_Through feats of strength and fire duels of course.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_Uh.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_Well, you know what us dragons say, push past the pain.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_Whatever. i don't care as long as none of you get in my way.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_Where are you going?
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_Where'd spike and starlight go?
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_Yeah? then maybe you can help.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_You both have cutie marks with sparkley things.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_You could have told garble about my friends.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_You should have more things made of rocks.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_You turned into a bear to defend spike.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_You're right! but what happened to the lava?
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_and from now on, in my kingdom, that's exactly what we will do!
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_it can't answer you. it's an egg.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_shouldn't you be doing whatever it is you do At twilight's school?
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_the heat makes them hatch.
Ember_Neutral_Noisy_the party one? apple dash? or was that the country one?
Ember_Neutral_Very Noisy_Hey! you. little fella.
Ember_Neutral_Very Noisy_That's what friends do. and, i am. i mean we are.
Ember_Neutral_Very Noisy_What was that?
Ember_Neutral__Besides, he doesn't even want to compete. let him go.
Ember_Neutral__Dragons aren't much for touchy feely stuff.
Ember_Neutral__Guess what, spike?
Ember_Neutral__Hey, spike!
Ember_Neutral__I had no idea it was polite to decorate your walls In your friends' favorite foods.
Ember_Neutral__I have a gauntlet to win.
Ember_Neutral__I really do feel better.
Ember_Neutral__In the dragonlands everything's just rocks or the color of ash.
Ember_Neutral__Listen spike, i wouldn't have made it this far without you.
Ember_Neutral__Nice to see you too, uh, which one are you again?
Ember_Neutral__Nice!
Ember_Neutral__Not really. unless i count you.
Ember_Neutral__Oh, sorry.
Ember_Neutral__Oh. i don't know if i like it, but ok.
Ember_Neutral__Ok. thanks.
Ember_Neutral__Or i could go without you.
Ember_Neutral__Part of friendship is saying hi to your friends, right?
Ember_Neutral__Riiiiight.
Ember_Neutral__So i guess, if you want to, we could keep working together.
Ember_Neutral__Sounds good.
Ember_Neutral__That's how you do it.
Ember_Neutral__That's it.
Ember_Neutral__The dragon lord. dragon lord spike.
Ember_Neutral__They're, probably sad.
Ember_Neutral__This is a weird friendship thing you ponies do, right?
Ember_Neutral__To prepare for the gauntlet.
Ember_Neutral__Usually when i do that the dragons are eager to meet me.
Ember_Neutral__We should go visit her then.
Ember_Neutral__Well, i'm certainly learning a lot about friendship.
Ember_Neutral__Well, there's only one winner, one scepter And one dragon lord.
Ember_Neutral__Well, you'll have at least one friend here too.
Ember_Neutral__You could have had one less competitor.
Ember_Neutral__You're the leader for a reason.
Ember_Neutral__and now we're through the tunnel so.
Ember_Neutral__come meet smolder.
Ember_Neutral__dragon lord spike. hmm. has a nice ring to it.
Ember_Neutral__er So where is twilight?
Ember_Neutral__watching over eggs is just part of the glamorous life Of a dragonlord.
Ember_Sad_Noisy_Definitely not happy.
Ember_Sad_Noisy_Kinda low.
Ember_Sad_Noisy_never come out.
Ember_Shouting_Very Noisy_Agree with him!
Ember_Surprised Confused_Noisy_Nothing? you just risked everything to save her.
Ember_Surprised Confused__Ponies? what are they doing here?

Firelight_Neutral_Noisy_and then, i thought the best way To look for a friendship problem in the present.
Firelight_Neutral__Apparently we're not supposed to prance Or canter after dinnertime Could that be the problem? sillyfilly?
Firelight_Neutral__Aww, don't be disappointed puddin'.
Firelight_Neutral__Because there is no friendship.

Fluttershy_Anxious_Noisy_But how can we get everypony to believe that's what he's doing?
Fluttershy_Anxious_Noisy_But it was so good.
Fluttershy_Anxious_Noisy_But it's my fault.
Fluttershy_Anxious_Noisy_But rainbow! you didn't want a pet that couldn't fly because it would keep you grounded and hold you back, remember?
Fluttershy_Anxious_Noisy_But that was different, that was an emergency!
Fluttershy_Anxious_Noisy_But that's because everypony is so nice and their village is so pretty and.
Fluttershy_Anxious_Noisy_But we can't leave now, Not with angel lost somewhere in this dangerous old castle.

Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_A beautiful habitat where every animal, whether sick.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_A hop.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_A one, a two, a one, two, three.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_A place that is safe but not restrictive, cozy but natural.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Aah.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Actually, i'm not afraid, i'm perfectly fine with it.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Ah-ahh.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Ahem, i mean, leave my friend alone please.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Ahem. it's wonderful that you all could join me To discuss the ponyville sanctuary project.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_All i had to do was cross reference A book about masks, with another book On ancient equestrian healers.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_All i had to offer you in exchange was one little jewel.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_All i'm saying is, it's an opportunity To expand your circle of friends.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_All servants of queen chrysalis found in These woods must be, destroyed!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_All that really matters to me Is that poor little philomena here gets well.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_All the animals. got it.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_All the creatures here must have.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_And after that.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_And even though at first, she thought you were The most annoying fan pony she ever met.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_And every afternoon tells the star That the director wants to get rid of her. but neither is true.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_And i am very sorry about that.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_And i really believe it'll work.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_And if i say this is what i want.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_And if your honesty hadn't convinced the kirin to talk, We wouldn't need to find it.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_And not true french haute couture.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_And now i know more then ever that you must leave before it's too late.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_And that breeze is very important, but so is cheering on those teeny tiny little things.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_And that you shouldn't let anypony pressure you into doing something you don't think is right.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_And the flying prairinos, the pink prairie dog family, Say gladmane keeps changing their act To make each trainer think the other is doing it.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_And the more she uses it, the more it will corrupt her.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_And they wouldn't listen to me any other way.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_And to believe in yourself.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_And we can't change the way other ponies think about us.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_And we never would have found out what gladmane was doing.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_And we promise.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_And what do dragons talk about?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_And when they spit them out, They grow into even more productive apple trees.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_And whoever wears it is blessed with untold.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_And without the e e a, it'll be much friendlier.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_And yes, it took me a while to get there.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Are you ready?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_As i recall, during your Workshop you promised one hundred percent Satisfaction guaranteed, or you pay nothing.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_As it is the wondrous private gated garden that surrounds the dance.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_At least, somepony will like, a medic or, or a doctor, or a nurse.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Back up, twilight! i don't want you to get hurt!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Because she'll never get past this until she lets it all out.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Because that's what friends do.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Because you need some water?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Because, we know how much a gold medal means to you.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Before you go, would you mind, helping me tidy up?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Besides, it's just a casual get-together, right?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Breezies, i must say sea breeze has a point.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Building the sanctuary didn't go quite as planned.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_But animals are my field of expertise.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_But for now, baby steps everypony, baby steps.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_But getting that book seems so important to you, so if you need me to help you first.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_But hiding behind these fears means you are only hiding from your true self.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_But i don't want to clear the trees, i want to use them.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_But i'm afraid this just isn't going to be one of them.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_But i've learned that standing Up for yourself isn't the same As changing who you are.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_But if you don't enjoy it, that's ok, too.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_But it's just like when i was afraid to sing In front of anypony.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_But one wouldn't be enough, He'd need more, way more.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_But rainbow dash, just because you've failed the sonic rainboom a hundred thousand times in practice.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_But she's afraid of quesadillas.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_But the truth of the matter is that i must be firm!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_But there's really nothing to be afraid of.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_But they're definitely having trouble And solving a friendship problem is important, No matter who's having it.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_But what happened to them all?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_But you're bigger than she is and you should know better.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_But, she's met us all before.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_But, these cheers should be quiet cheers. we don't want to startle them.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_But, your rhythm is just a teeny, tiny bit off.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Bye, girls.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Bye, girls.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Can't you just tell us your pen pal's name?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Certainly, but remember, these are bunnies we're dealing with, not cows.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Chugga chugga, chugga chugga, whoo whoo!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Clarissa the pig has two tails And, while her singing voice is lovely, I don't think it's magical.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Come join us.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Come on, it'll be fun.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Come on, now. You're not gonna get better if you don't cooperate.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Critters don't live the same way ponies do.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Do you realize what this means?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Do you think maybe you owe somepony an apology?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Doctor fauna needs my help with a serious problem.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Doctor fluttershy expected that.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Don't worry, twilight.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Don't you have more important things to do? like prepare rainbow for her big test?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Don't you worry, philomena.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Drab? you're calling the colors of beautiful trees, drab?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Even if our food's spoiled, These blueberries are still good to eat.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Even then, i'm not sure we'd find out What happened here over a thousand years ago.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Every critter would be welcome.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Every nightmare night i shut myself in my cottage And refuse to come out until morning.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Every pony gets mad sometimes.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Excuse me.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Feathered or furry, scaly or slimy.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Feeling better pinkie?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Finally, a pony who understands that the couture in this shop Is far too brilliant to even consider selling.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Fine! you can stay here.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Flash bees can get pretty aggressive. I guess that's why none of the other bayou animals Can get to the water.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_For a land that's all rocks, this place is surprisingly easy to get lost in.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_For instance, this poor little eagle with a sprained wing Might be better off up in one of the towers.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_For the animals of course.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_For the record, i don't mind.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Garbage.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Gesundheit!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Gingerly tiptoe around him?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Go ahead. you can do it.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Good morning, friends.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Good morning, pony tones.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Gummy's an earth pony, winona's a unicorn, and tank is a pegasus.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Hello, flash bees!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Hello? is anypony there?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Here you go.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Hey there fluttershys, any ideas on how to discord up this tea party?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Hi fluttershy, thanks for asking!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Hmm, did we check the unabridged versions?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Hmm, let's see. asparagus.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_How did you even know to look for an aura on a waterfall?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_How did you ever get in such bad condition?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_How was your booksort cation?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Huh, she's not here.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Hummingway here was sick once too.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I Guess i let my imagination get the best of me.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I already have the perfect solution That'll make the critters happy and give you more space.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I appreciate your input, but i just know the animals Would be happiest with dirt brown pillows And leaf green accents.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I can always tell what angel is feeling. But these kirin, don't show anything.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I can only imagine.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I can't rest until zecora is healed!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I didn't.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I don't know why i doubted myself for a second.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I don't mean to interrupt, but aren't you forgetting about somepony?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I don't think it's that big of a surprise.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I doubt the princess will even notice.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I dreamt about a blue smoke thingy too!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I forgot to stock up on food for angel And you do seem to have quite a lot.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I guess it's harder for her when she feels like the lemon.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I guess the map wasn't on the fritz after all.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I guess you had to be there.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I guess, acting like the ponies of saddle row, Gave me the confidence to interact with them.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I had to finish taking care of a patient first.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I had to rescue sea breeze from serious harm.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I heard that explosion, and i saw the rainbow, too.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I hope you don't mind, But we're all doing a little spring cleaning for you.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I just know animals feel safe and happy under your care.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I know discord still makes mistakes sometimes.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I know how you like them.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I know they both have a special place in their heart for you.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I know this is unconventional, but that's because We're trying to do something that's never been done before.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I know what'll clear up that tickle in your throat, A humidifier.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I know you all worked hard.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I know you and the rest of the apple family Have had your issues with flim and flam in the past.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I know you want to run.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I know, but what i found out is.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I know.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I love the ponytones, i'm one of their biggest fans.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I mean no offense.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I mean,  yay.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I mean, it's time for bed, don't you think?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I mean, since we're stuck here anyway.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I met her on a trip to see the breezies.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I never thought i'd get to be in anything like a hall of fame.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I packed cauliflower bites.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I promised angel we'd go on a Picnic.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I see that discord's far from perfect.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I see.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I think he lost his magic too.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I think it's lovely.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I think we can all agree that now that you've eaten And you have a little energy going in your breezy bodies, You're strong enough to face the breeze.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I want to thank you all For rushing right over when i called.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I was sure that she would be here today.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I was thinking we could do a special breezie cheer!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I wish she'd told us what kind of flowers she's looking for.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I won't let it happen to another.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I wouldn't miss it.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I wouldn't want you to go through any trouble.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I'll get there someday.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I'll see you at the spa, our usual time?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I'll stay here.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I'll talk to him.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I'm certain they're doing their best to find me.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I'm fluttershy, and um, i'm here too.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I'm having a very hard time remebering what he looks like.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I'm just heading out so, you just make yourself at home while i'm gone.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I'm just wondering if it's okay if I hold you down against your will for a little bit?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I'm looking for something less like a cage.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I'm not scared of caves.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I'm not so sure letting zephyr move back home is a good idea.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I'm not used to holding anything more than a bunny or two.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I'm on it.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I'm pretty sure we should help flim and flam.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I'm so sorry, but I just wanted to mention that Applejack is also helping me this week.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I'm sure discord will catch tirek and this will all be over soon.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I'm sure i can get the other monsters to help.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I'm sure if we just let them know how special that particular apple is to you, they'll leave it alone.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I'm sure you could work out your differences If you just sat down and talked to each other.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I'm the one who did it.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I'm very thankful the ponytones are singing at the pet center fundraiser.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I've left her there in the basket.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I've never heard of that.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I, i just don't even know what to say.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_I, know that she's a true friend, and i'll do anything i can to help her.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_If giving up my cutie mark means i get to stay in this lovely village with these lovely ponies, then i'll do it.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_If i hadn't given it a try, I never would've found out how much i enjoy it.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_If it means that much to you, twilight, we're in.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_If that's who we need to cure you, then i'm going to find her!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_If this little lady can crawl all the way here From western equestria, i can find a way to build her A safe place to rest!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_If you need more practice, we can keep going.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_If you read a little further, you'll see.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_If you really wanna help, i suppose serving tea Would be nice.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_In fact, if i had rested, like twilight suggested all along.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_In you go.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Inside and out.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Isn't there some way to banish him without losing all of you?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_It looks, so juicy.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_It must be a really important one.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_It never hurts to make new friends.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_It really adds a shine to their coat.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_It seems like she feels really bad.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_It was angel's idea.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_It would.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_It's almost too easy.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_It's an elephant.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_It's been lovely.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_It's called the alicorn amulet.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_It's called, shh!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_It's going to be ok, i promise.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_It's healthy for him, just like sleeping is healthy for us.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_It's just, not what i expected it's quite, lovely.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_It's like, a long sleep.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_It's my special gift, you know.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_It's not a joke.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_It's not so bad, Rainbow dash.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_It's not so much the grand galloping gala.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_It's not that we don't appreciate their help.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_It's ok, lola. we all move at our own pace.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_It's ok, she's gone.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_It's ok, you were all just trying to help.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_It's ok. i really want you all to have fun.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_It's ok. i've got this, girls.

Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_It's, nice.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Just put one hoof in front of the other.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Just remember not to turn away from them, cattail.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Just three more bites.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_La la la la la la la la la.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Listen up! i am more assertive.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Lots of control.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Mama duck, you're free and clear.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Maybe there's somepony we can ask.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Maybe we just need a little rest.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Maybe you can lead the field trip together.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Maybe you'd like a song?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Maybe.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Maybe?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Me? oh yes, your highness.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Mm hm.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_More like a nice hug. maybe if we lose that part.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_No no no no, the other staircase.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_No walls, more like an enclosure that melts into the trees.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_No worries rarity.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_No! no cages. i want to give the animals the freedom To come and go.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_No, her vet clinic is a bit maybe, um, overrun.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_No, i'm just good with animals.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_No, not fast. you have to wake animals slowly.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_No, not that way.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_No, the male bees aren't aggressive around the queen bee.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Not at all, I am weak and helpless, and i appreciate their understanding.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Not especially.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Not exactly.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Not that you'll need it. i'm sure you'll win.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Not too fast, now, angel bunny.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Nothing says let's be friends like a cake that says Let's be friends!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Nothing's gonna get past fluttershy.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Now i don't have to step a hoof outside Until this whole thing is over.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Now i know how to put my hoof Down, without being unpleasant or mean.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Now let's not jump to any conclusions.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Now now, every mouse has got to wait their turn.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Now now, he has learned his lesson.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Now that's more like it!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Now, follow me please.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Now, is that any way to talk to a friend?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Noisy_Now, let's discuss the theme of nature As it applies to hoofcliff's love.

Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_After a quick bath, they were more than willing to help.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_After you left i realized that i wasn't ready To give up on nightmare night.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_All i have is this jewel.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_All of this is one headpiece?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_All of us?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_All servants of queen chrysalis found In these woods, must be, destroyed!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_And applejack, and rainbow dash, and pinkie pie.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_And even though they may look a teeny bit scary, They're actually very sweet and help keep other more dangerous insects away.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_And every day, the unicorns helping starswirl would use so much magic, they lost their powers.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_And everything will be fine.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_And he's happy to see us too.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_And how is our patient doing?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_And i can't wait to get the mud out of my mane.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_And i had never been near the ground before.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_And i know they can do it.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_And i may be good at being a part of it, but it's no fun For me to see my friends feel like they're in danger.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_And i'm sure you have to get the castle ready.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_And of course, harry was the especially scary monster.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_And quitting doesn't feel much better, does it?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_And that magic protects the pollen they're carrying from being destroyed.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_And the chicken for a lamp.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_And then, out of nowhere.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Angel was the scary figure that kept scurrying after you in the maze.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Are those, for us?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_As you can see, there's a big mess down here at sweet apple acres.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Banish you, princess luna, to the moon.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Be sure you get plenty on his tail Or it won't get as poofy as he likes it.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Because he's afraid that the two of you together Could move in and take over his resort.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Before you keep fighting, There is something you should know!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Being kind to him and letting him be my house guest.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Better?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Black, green, red and blue red, black, hold one and two Red. blue. red once more. green black blue red three and four!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Blue. red. step ahead green, black, now step back.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Boy, was i wrong.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_But gladmane is behind so many other friendship problems.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_But he says first you'll have to apologize for calling him, a nuisance.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_But i knew that was difficult as it was, Pushing them away was the kindest thing i could do!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_But it um, started out all right.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_But it's daytime.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_But it's time to get up now. Spring is coming.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_But piles thought it would be better To start by building a shelter, To protect them against the cold and wind.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_But um, we were wondering if we could get by to check on tirek?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_But we aren't gonna need a spell.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_But we'd all really appreciate it if you'd calm down and, um, maybe rest for a bit?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_But, he was singing really off-key.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_But, if this is ponyville, Why are our cutie marks over there?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_But, they disagreed on how to go about it.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Butterflies don't fly as high as my cloud home.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_By fighting, you're destroying the very thing That brought you here in the first place!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Can't be too much left in there.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Claims that every morning, gladmane tells the director.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Close. i'm going to a masquerade ball. without the mask.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Dear princess celestia.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Do you think he knows?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Do you think the map could be on the fritz again?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Does that mean that the map is calling us somewhere else?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Does this mean you'll do it?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Don't listen to them. You're gonna win that competition for sure!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Don't worry angel, I won't forget you.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Even if i know they're not.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Even then, the valley, and all the animals in it, Continued to be caught in the crossfire.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Exactly where grub was going to start his farm!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Frazzled?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Fuzzy legs made the sticky wall That made it difficult for you to see and move.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Gee, rainbow dash.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Good! now.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Goodbye!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Goodbye, everypony!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Grub wanted to start by planting crops so that Everypony would have something to eat.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Grub was upset.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_He just wants a chance to compete, he won't get in the way. you won't even know he's here.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_He said so.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_He says hello.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Hello there, hummingway. i'm ever so happy to see you.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Here you go, angel bunny.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Hi everypony.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Hmm? oh, um. coming.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Hope you had some wonderful dreams and restful hibernation.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_How can you be sure he isn't the cause of yours?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_How's that feeling now for you philomena?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Hurry along butterflies, Before that ball comes and hits you.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_I actually hate commander hurricane A lot more than i hate you guys.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_I assumed that i'd be just as good with kids As i am with animals..
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_I can promise to not do anything fun at all if that would help.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_I can't believe i've never heard you speak of the smooze before.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_I can't help you anymore!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_I can't let rarity down. i must do this.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_I did want to trade this bear call i've got for a bird whistle.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_I don't think you're quite there yet.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_I feel so much better going with a friend.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_I guess i.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_I guess we should find out why the hooffields Are launching tomatoes now.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_I had some help.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_I just have to be more bold, like twilight says.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_I mean, this place seems a lot more suited to pinkie pie.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_I need that cherry.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_I need to go to the market anyway.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_I really don't like it. it's just, not my cup of tea.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_I really learned the hard way Not to bite off more than i could chew.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_I sure hope maud has an appetite.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_I think it's time for me to get rainbow dash and her friends So they can create the breeze for you to get home.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_I think the key is to befriend him.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_I told you that entering the ponyville paw kour contest Was a dangerous idea.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_I truly wish i'd spend more time with boulder because.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_I will never use my element of harmony against you.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'd like to be a tree.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'll even get him to put the cottage back on the ground first.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm gonna take you all home with me And give you all hot cocoas.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm just surprised.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm not shy. And i hate animals.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm so glad you wandered by.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm so proud they decided to honor us.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm sure we'll find out when we get there.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_I've gathered all of the animals like you asked, starlight glimmer.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_I, princess celestia.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_If i'm going to be his friend, i have to start by giving him The benefit of the doubt!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_If it weren't for your history with flim and flam, You never would have be so determined to find Somepony else to help.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_If you count flim and flam, That's three big friendship problems all in the same place.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Is probably the best way to do that.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Isn't that right, my little patient?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_It certainly isn't for gladmane. It sounds like he's better off with them fighting.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_It is awful.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_It is?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_It sounds like an awful lot of pressure, Having to learn everything so quickly.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_It was a good plan. we need to think of another one.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_It's just a bear call.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_It's like taking a really long nap during winter.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_It's much better to face those fears, so you can shine, and be the best pony you can possibly be.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_It's not so bad.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_It's nothing like your book said it would be!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Just snow.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Let us celebrate our first celestial year of peace.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Let's see, I also need tomatoes.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Listen discord, i just want to make sure you know that If there's anything i can do to.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Long ago, there were two best friends, Grub hooffield and piles mccolt.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Look. phase two is working.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Make me a dress, rarity. please!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Maybe if you spent some time getting to know.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Meet me at my cottage in an hour.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Mister beaverton beaverteeth has agreed to take his dam apart and move it.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_My experiences with the breezies have helped me to see that kindness can take many forms.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_No. just regular tea.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Now angel, you really shouldn't.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Now girls, how about we do some nice coloring?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Now is not a good time, angel. we're having a dinner party.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Now the other bayou creatures can get to the water Without the bees feeling threatened.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Now this, is what i call a perfect nightmare night.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Now you understand.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Now, just start walking.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh i will, and i hope you have fun with cadance.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh i've never been there before.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh no problem.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh of course! but watch your step!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh spike, it's okay. it could have happened to any one of us.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh! you were called, too!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, and probably spike.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, come on girls. Why don't we go see how clouds are made?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, i can understand the language of all kinds of creatures!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, i don't think she's home.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, i'm so sorry.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, of course i do!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, okay, then. see you later.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, um, everypony?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, um, whatever you think is best.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, where are we? what's the rush?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Or even rainbow dash.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Or maybe, a pair of ponies?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Perhaps a bee?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Photo Finish wouldn't want me to model anymore. She'd find somepony else with, the magic!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Pinkie pie, care for some gravy?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Plenty for everypony.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Plus, i really need to rest up for that big pancake breakfast tomorrow.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Refreshing.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_She did raise her voice at one of my birds during rehearsal.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_She's got to be about done by now.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Shh. It's okay.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Slow down, sweetie.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_So he'd come to trust and listen to me.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_So i asked granny smith if i could try to make the maze Even scarier for my friends.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_So it's time you both put your differences aside and come together.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_So piles went ahead and built a shelter anyway.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_So they made a promise to each other to protect And preserve the valley for all its adorable furry inhabitants.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Somehow, i had the ability To communicate with the animals on a different level.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Sometimes it can be hard for a Shy pony like me to stand up for myself.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Sometimes, being afraid can stop you from doing something that you love.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Technically he's a tortoise, and he's always dreamed of being somepony's pet.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Tell you what, bring all the ponies over for a dinner party this evening, And i'll bet his manners will have really improved by then.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Thank goodness.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Thank you ever so much for staying To give angel a bath too, but, um, I think he's dry.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Thank you.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_That certainly would be a nasty changeling trick, wouldn't it?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_That does explain the paper eating.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_That looks like fun.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_That the star wants control of the show.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_That's gorgeous. and where there's nature.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_That's right! and they only have two days to get that pollen back Before the portal to their home closes.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_That's what i've been trying.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_That's why it's ever so important that we help them make their way through ponyville safely.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_The best at what?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_The history of the wonderbolts!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_The two ponies were unable to come to an understanding.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_The valley suffered from the constant destruction.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Then how do you explain this?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Then smokey junior found a nice home in the crawl space Behind the building.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_There doesn't seem to be anything wrong Around here at all.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_There's nothing i could've traded it for that's more valuable to me than you.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_There's nothing to be afraid of.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_There, there, rarity.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_There, there. that's a good orthros.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_They kept fighting back and forth, Until it turned into a feud!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_They must have gone bad without magic to keep them cold.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Twilight sparkle likes vanilla ice cream, red balloons, dancing.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Two point three?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Um, excuse me?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Um, there's a picture here of that necklace trixie wears.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Um, we didn't.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Um. it didn't go exactly how i thought it would.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Until finally, the hooffields and mccolts Moved to separate mountains.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Wake up, little sleepyheads.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_We do lots of fun things together.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_We have to try! i've got our route all planned out, And on the way we can check up on zecora.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_We're fine, everything's going great. isn't it, angel?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_We, could celebrate nightmare night together every year.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well you see, it's the breeze that activates the breezies' magic.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, bernard, that adorable bunny from the acrobat's hat.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, i don't hate you.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, i'm sure you have nothing to worry about.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, until now.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_What do you hope to get out of fighting?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_What if i just wear the dress?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_What? these sweet little angels?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_When somepony tries to block, show them that you rock.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_When they found the valley between the smokey mountains, They knew it was something special!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_When you left you said mane therapy was your calling.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Where's spike?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Who wants a feather massage?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Woo.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Would you mind moving your carts so i can pass?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Yes, but they had to go.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Yes, but, i've also realized something.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_You know what i see?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_You probably can't wait to get back to your castle And take your own bath, huh?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_You really didn't have to stay all day.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_You really should have come to me sooner.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_You see?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_You seem to have everything under control.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_You were probably going to say no, anyway.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_You'd never guess but, when i was little, I was very shy.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_You're right, my friends. i shouldn't give up. I will get my confidence up and show everypony that i am a good flyer!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_You've been glaring so hard.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Your turn now, philomena.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Zephyr is my brother and i love him, But he's never learned to do anything for himself.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_Zephyr you're smart and talented.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_all right, little ones, this way. this way.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_and a very weak flyer.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_and sometimes being too kind can actually keep a friend  from doing what they need to do.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_but it's sometimes the kindest thing you can do.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_but mister stripes demolished it So they were temporarily camped out in the back Until they found a new place to live.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_dear princess celestia.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_don't be scared of what awaits you.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_girls.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_have a seat.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_here you go.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_i can't believe the ponies of appleoosa Built this place.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_i can't wait to show you to my friends.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_i guess you were hungry.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_i think a perfect equestria looks a lot like a hearth's warming eve party.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_i'm not sure. I'm also not sure where these other two came from.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_i've been known to get my hooves dirty.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_it's the perfect amount of purple.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_now you try!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_oh no! there's a tiny kitten that needs a home! but you are over scheduled right now, you don't have time to help!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_oh um, maybe we should try this again later.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_oh, are you hungry?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_oh, no! there is none!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_pinkie pie, look to your left, and ask your best friend to pass the cucumber sandwiches.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_pinkie, do you want the other one?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_snowfall frost?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_so I decided to fly as many as I can on over to Froggy Bottom Bogg.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_so he tore down piles' Shelter so he could plant his crops!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_step on whatever color i name. let's begin.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_thanks pinkie pie.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_that's when it brought you back from stone.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_that's why she's the princess.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_there she is!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_they certainly don't seem to be getting along.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_this should appear to scare you!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_tortoise.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_um, I can do that, i think.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_um, Well, okay.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_wait a second.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_welcome to fluttershy's tea party!
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_well, i may have kept just one.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_what should we do to celebrate?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_what with the frogs all hopping into each other and all.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_why are our cutie marks over there?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_wishing them away may seem cruel.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_you Must, you must, you must.
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_you don't suppose we've been brought here to help them?
Fluttershy_Neutral_Very Noisy_you okay, twilight sparkle?
Fluttershy_Neutral__A confusing pep talk but nonetheless.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Actually, i said i was going to tea with the princess. You're going to work.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Actually, it wasn't all bad. I particularly liked it when you made the clouds spin.
Fluttershy_Neutral__After years of experience with animals, I've picked up a few things.
Fluttershy_Neutral__All right, since you really want to know.
Fluttershy_Neutral__And I still need to pick up food for the swans and doves who flew ahead to Canterlot.
Fluttershy_Neutral__And also, what you're saying And, also the way you're saying it.
Fluttershy_Neutral__And besides, dogtail.
Fluttershy_Neutral__And caring for animals.
Fluttershy_Neutral__And do it my way this time.
Fluttershy_Neutral__And he certainly knows his stuff when it comes to buildings.
Fluttershy_Neutral__And he just got plenty of cupcakes.
Fluttershy_Neutral__And i don't want to get ahead of myself.
Fluttershy_Neutral__And i know just the pony who can help.
Fluttershy_Neutral__And i'm admiral fairy flight from the seventh squadron.
Fluttershy_Neutral__And if you're really angry, then take some time away To be a nirik where it won't hurt anypony.
Fluttershy_Neutral__And right now!
Fluttershy_Neutral__And she won't be embarrassed.
Fluttershy_Neutral__And the crystal heart.
Fluttershy_Neutral__And the overdesign is reminiscent of.
Fluttershy_Neutral__And then they wake up in spring. and see?
Fluttershy_Neutral__And um, pretty much everything else.
Fluttershy_Neutral__And we can probably skip this one.
Fluttershy_Neutral__And, i think i actually know what to do.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Animals often hibernate through the winter to save their energy and eat less food.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Applejack, we can always find A way to fix that hole in the roof.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Applejack, we can always find A way to fix that hole in the roof.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Are you coughing because there's a carrot stuck in your throat?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Are you feeling all right?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Aren't classes that way?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Aren't they? This is my favorite task the whole season.
Fluttershy_Neutral__As you all know, princess celestia hoped We'd help discord use his magic for good instead of evil.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Aside from, locking us in here and trying to brainwash us into abandoning the things that make us special.
Fluttershy_Neutral__At least that's what i've been telling everypony.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Because he's not a huge, gigantic, terrifying, enormous.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Because i'm never going to sing in front of anypony ever again.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Because you didn't ask me to.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Better, but it still needs something.
Fluttershy_Neutral__But I'm sure it's not because they're worried about you.
Fluttershy_Neutral__But don't worry.
Fluttershy_Neutral__But i can't build the sanctuary alone. will you join me?
Fluttershy_Neutral__But i can't today Sorry.
Fluttershy_Neutral__But i do not want to perform with them.
Fluttershy_Neutral__But i know that letting all the experts go was the right call.
Fluttershy_Neutral__But i'll be watching safely from the audience.
Fluttershy_Neutral__But it's hard for them to hear you when you're shouting and being mean.
Fluttershy_Neutral__But sibling dynamics are hard. trust me.
Fluttershy_Neutral__But thanks to all of you, I've learned I'm always less scared when I'm with my friends.
Fluttershy_Neutral__But then, a student named celestia, discovered she had the power to raise the sun herself, without draining her magic!
Fluttershy_Neutral__But this pony pox has really knocked me for a loop.
Fluttershy_Neutral__But we can change how we let it affect us.
Fluttershy_Neutral__But when they get mad, they turn into niriks, Creatures made of fire and vengeance.
Fluttershy_Neutral__But you shouldn't worry a bit about not being able to be in the tryouts.
Fluttershy_Neutral__But zephyr will never stand on his own if he can lean on you.
Fluttershy_Neutral__But, how?
Fluttershy_Neutral__But, i didn't try to eat ponies?
Fluttershy_Neutral__But, it could've been a no.
Fluttershy_Neutral__But, princess celestia, i'm the one who took your pet bird.
Fluttershy_Neutral__But, uh, you know, Um, whatever you want to do is fine.
Fluttershy_Neutral__But, um, we don't have a team.
Fluttershy_Neutral__But.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Can you imagine anything more upsetting?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Care for a carrot ginger sandwich?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Celestia and luna, back when they were happy.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Choo!
Fluttershy_Neutral__Did my cheering do that?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Did she get you too?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Did that sound ok?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Didn't you see what he did to New fluttershy?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Discord's headed to an O and O convention, or he'd be joining us.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Discord? oh, there you are.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Disguises.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Dizzy?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Do you like it?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Do you need help knitting?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Do you think you'll be ready to play with applejack And rainbow dash against the appleloosa team?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Does that mean you'll have to close rarity for you?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Does that sound like a shop pony to you?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Don't be scared little friends.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Don't be silly, doctor fauna.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Each of us search a sector.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Eloise and Hubert, you should go too.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Equestria was suffering terrible hardship.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Even applejack and i argue.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Even if i don't exactly have what it takes to be a shop pony.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Even if those guidelines, aren't, working?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Even tortoises do it.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Everyone else gets to ride, since the trip's too much for your little wings.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Everything is fine. in fact, it's more than fine.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Feeling better?
Fluttershy_Neutral__First of all, you gotta redecorate this place.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Fly, my pretties!
Fluttershy_Neutral__Forever!
Fluttershy_Neutral__Fostering friendships is what ponies do.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Friends?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Furniture on the ground?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Gee, i don't know, it's a pretty big pack.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Girls!
Fluttershy_Neutral__Girls.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Go and get your things. Rarity's here to see you home.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Go on, now! fly away and get us help!
Fluttershy_Neutral__Going to return philomena, remember?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Good and good for you.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Good.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Goodness! A Whirling Mungtooth!
Fluttershy_Neutral__Got it.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Gotcha!
Fluttershy_Neutral__Have you heard from zephyr? is he doing well?
Fluttershy_Neutral__He can be very helpful.
Fluttershy_Neutral__He's just going to hibernate.
Fluttershy_Neutral__He's just wonderful.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Here comes the choo-choo train.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Here you go philomena, this will fix you right up.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Here.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Hi rainbow dash.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Honestly, the game was a little scary at first.
Fluttershy_Neutral__How did you know you could control your temper?
Fluttershy_Neutral__How do you feel about book clubs?
Fluttershy_Neutral__How?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Huh?
Fluttershy_Neutral__I agree with twilight, and rarity.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I agree. which is why you should move out.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I am! i am ready to take on nightmare night.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I appreciate you sharing your thoughts, But i need everypony to respect mine.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I asked the raccoons to leave.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I can't believe you'd think we don't.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I can't tell if my eyes are open or closed.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I can't wait to meet all of them and hear their ideas.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I certainly learned that if you don't take care of yourself.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I could, if he was talking.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I didn't know dragons could talk.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I didn't mean for this to happen.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I don't think he needs that.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I don't think they would have sent the invitation if they didn't want you to come.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I even went to bed early last night, But then i had a really scary nightmare.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I feel ready to attack the day.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I guess i forgot to jump.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I guess i have some imagination.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I guess i just don't want my little friends to be scared.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I guess i'm just as good with kids as i am with animals.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I guess not.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I had no idea you all have colds!
Fluttershy_Neutral__I have to help her, just like meadowbrook helped her mother And all those bayou ponies long ago.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I have to restock my pantry for our tea party next week.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I hope not. I've had quite enough life threatening adventures, Thank you very much.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I hope you're right about the girls coming here.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I just feel bad you never got a chance to actually be in it.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I just found out.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I know i promised not to have any fun today, but I couldn't help myself.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I know it's a long way, but don't worry. I'll bring plenty of snacks to restore your energy before we perform.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I know our friends want us to win but.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I know speaking up for yourself can be hard, believe me.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I know you both want to help But, don't you remember last time?
Fluttershy_Neutral__I know you love to win, and you should go with the team that surely will.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I know, plenty of.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I know.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I know. it just seems like his place always ends up Being your place.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I made a promise not to use my element against him, And i'm going to keep it.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I mean, all i needed to do Was just show them who's in charge.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I mean, this is where discord lives, and you're telling me There aren't any stairs that lead to nowhere?
Fluttershy_Neutral__I need you to all gather here in the middle.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I probably know more about being scared than anypony.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I refuse to accept that! there has to be somepony who can help you.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I suppose his heartbeat could be A teensy weensy eensy bit slower than usual.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I suppose i could have gone with something a bit scarier.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I think i may be walking in circles.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I think it's time for grown up ones.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I think we need to pay a visit to doctor fauna.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I think you and i are the only ones left.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I think you just cut in front of me.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I think you'd have fun with them.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I thought you and dash were going to play.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I thought you might say that.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I tipped over that cup.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I totally feel you.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I uh, i suppose i could take them for the night.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I uh, wanted to leave room for all of you.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I vote for calm.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I want the sanctuary to have an open floor plan.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I was hoping i could get some of your honey.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I wonder if meadowbrook was looking for a cure For swamp fever too.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I would just like to ask I mean, if it would be all right.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I wouldn't expect you to throw a tea party the way i would.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I'd be honored.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I'd hate to lie to them, They've been so welcoming and friendly.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I'd like to lock them in.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I'd love to but, if we solved the problem already.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I'll make your special recipe.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I'll show you. He mostly just needs to see you.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I'll take a bunch of these.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I'll take that as a.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I'm confused.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I'm flattered, really.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I'm glad we got the chance for one last rehearsal.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I'm going to re build the sanctuary.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I'm just happy to be with all of you.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I'm scared of.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I'm so glad you asked.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I'm so glad you're here.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I'm sorry i asked you to leave.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I'm sorry i took the whole Assertiveness thing too far.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I'm sorry, but Twilight has an important magical research project, and she's asked for my help.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I'm sorry, but no means no.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I'm sure the princess will appreciate the help.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I'm sure they'd be happy to see you.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I'm sure your home isn't too far away.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I'm wearing it.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I've got the key.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I've made a vow not to use it except in dire circumstances.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I, um, can't see you.
Fluttershy_Neutral__I.
Fluttershy_Neutral__If I don't get them fed, they'll be too pooped to perform.
Fluttershy_Neutral__If it wasn't for me, You wouldn't have been sick in the first place.
Fluttershy_Neutral__If she needed help, i think she'd realize it.
Fluttershy_Neutral__If that is what you really want.
Fluttershy_Neutral__If we build a sanctuary for them, They can have their own apples to enjoy.
Fluttershy_Neutral__If we just told each other the truth.
Fluttershy_Neutral__If you don't mind.
Fluttershy_Neutral__If you haven't given it to someone else.
Fluttershy_Neutral__If you're free.
Fluttershy_Neutral__If you're looking for something to do.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Iron will's not a monster, He's a minotaur.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Is it you rarity?
Fluttershy_Neutral__It is you.
Fluttershy_Neutral__It looks just like your cutie mark.
Fluttershy_Neutral__It took five great sorcerers.
Fluttershy_Neutral__It'll take us less time to go through everything.
Fluttershy_Neutral__It's like the end of an era.
Fluttershy_Neutral__It's not playtime yet.
Fluttershy_Neutral__It's okay twilight, So our friends' manners aren't perfect.
Fluttershy_Neutral__It's, nice.
Fluttershy_Neutral__It's, um, good to see you too.
Fluttershy_Neutral__It, really blends in with the bark.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Josephine, if you and the rest of the doves leave now, we should all arrive in Canterlot at the same time.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Just a little quieter.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Just don't forget us little ponies when you become the most famous designer in all of Equestria.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Leave?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Let me handle this. rainbow dash, your winter is going to be, pet less.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Let's put them where they don't belong.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Like a tiny mouse?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Maud would move mountains for her if she had to.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Maybe because we used them for healing magic Instead of banishing?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Maybe i need to start thinking like you.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Maybe i would have thought to use meadowbrook's mask sooner.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Maybe i'll just, stay here with spike.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Maybe not! look!
Fluttershy_Neutral__Maybe she just wants to tell us how last night's slumber went?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Maybe they keep their produce in the back?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Maybe we should just come back later.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Maybe we'd better go meet him halfway.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Me too.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Mm hmm.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Mmm. see? it's delicious.
Fluttershy_Neutral__My dear breezies.
Fluttershy_Neutral__My dream is to build a real animal sanctuary.
Fluttershy_Neutral__My favorite is number ten. She just looked like such a nice pony.
Fluttershy_Neutral__My parents would tell me about her whenever i was sick in bed.
Fluttershy_Neutral__My sanctuary can be the one place in equestria They call home.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Never.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Next time i'll ask Before taking matters into my own hooves.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Nice.
Fluttershy_Neutral__No hard feelings.
Fluttershy_Neutral__No matter how much things change, you'll always have this to look back on.
Fluttershy_Neutral__No need to cry.
Fluttershy_Neutral__No, but changelings can turn into ponies.
Fluttershy_Neutral__No, no. i do.
Fluttershy_Neutral__No, your necklace.
Fluttershy_Neutral__No.
Fluttershy_Neutral__None of the birds or insects I've talked to have heard of it either.
Fluttershy_Neutral__None of the other pillars seem to be having trouble Fitting in to the modern world.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Not that we don't appreciate it, isn't that right?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Nothing! he's perfectly fine.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Now i just hope princess celestia says we can do our play.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Now you should have plenty of room at the clinic.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Now you stay off that leg and do everything i told you.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Now, go pack your things.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Now, this might hurt for just a second.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Of course i did.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Of course she's good with magic, twilight's great with magic.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Of course, i'm happy to help, though I'm surprised you picked me.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Of course.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Of course. how about later today?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Oh certainly.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Oh dear, maybe they're lonely?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Oh dear.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Oh hello constance.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Oh i don't know how much practice you'll get Against us, we've been playing just awful.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Oh i wouldn't get too serious.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Oh no.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Oh that would be interesting.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Oh that's not it either.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Oh that's okay, you can come out!
Fluttershy_Neutral__Oh, angel's right. we'd better get going.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Oh, but just look at all these warrens and dens.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Oh, did you need some more water?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Oh, hello twilight. where are you off to?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Oh, i'd forgotten all about this lesson.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Oh, i'm so, so sorry.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Oh, i've never seen apple bloom and scootaloo argue like this.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Oh, if it's that important to you, of course i'll do it.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Oh, it's really not that much.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Oh, my.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Oh, rainbow dash!
Fluttershy_Neutral__Oh, rarity. you don't have to do that.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Oh, that sounds nice.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Oh, well i wasn't there So, i don't really know what happened.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Oh, what kind of a rock are they?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Oh, you poor, poor little baby.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Oh, you will? oh, that would be wonderful.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Oh, you're right.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Oh.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Oh. i guess that is true.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Ok, what else?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Okay girls. uh, what should we do?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Okay, good night.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Okay, i'll do it.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Okay, let's.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Okay.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Okay. i feel good.
Fluttershy_Neutral__On it!
Fluttershy_Neutral__Once upon a time, before celestia.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Once you get past terrifying, paralyzing stage fright.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Ooh, but i do like it.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Or maybe it's more of a non adventure.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Or maybe since we told them they were too young to come.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Or scared.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Or that we're going to play appleloosa.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Or, actually, kind of, you see.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Or, maybe not.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Other ponies may be experts in their fields.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Over a thousand years.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Pardon me, sir.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Passion.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Phew.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Plus starswirl the bearded to do it.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Pretty pretty please?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Princess celestia wouldn't have asked you to come today if she didn't think so.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Rainbow dash, if you hadn't scared the animals, I never would have learned i could communicate with them And gotten my cutie mark.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Raising the sun every morning was so hard.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Rare?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Rarity?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Sandbar was friends with all of the missing students.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Sea breeze, i understand your feelings are hurt.
Fluttershy_Neutral__She's mysterious.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Should we go in and help her maybe?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Shouldn't our cutie marks be glowing again?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Sleep tight, little one.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Smokey made too much noise eating garbage So, softpad's mother made them move out of the trash can.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Sneaking? it looks to me like the only one sneaking around Is you garble.
Fluttershy_Neutral__So here's the deal, you can come back with me, But you have to do exactly what i say, no exceptions.
Fluttershy_Neutral__So i did it for you.
Fluttershy_Neutral__So i guess what i'm trying to say is.
Fluttershy_Neutral__So i wasn't a vampire?
Fluttershy_Neutral__So predictable!
Fluttershy_Neutral__So tasty.
Fluttershy_Neutral__So the kirin decided to make sure It would never happen again.
Fluttershy_Neutral__So, can you build it?
Fluttershy_Neutral__So, no more crusading for tonight, all right?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Soon, equestria would lose all its magic users.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Speaking of which, where're we going?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Surprisingly.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Thank goodness maud was able to reach her in time.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Thanks for trying to protect me twilight.
Fluttershy_Neutral__That apple.
Fluttershy_Neutral__That book's pretty out of date but, it might be worth a try.
Fluttershy_Neutral__That is special.
Fluttershy_Neutral__That's pretty chaotic, right?
Fluttershy_Neutral__That's true.
Fluttershy_Neutral__That's what big sisters are for.
Fluttershy_Neutral__The creatures from the other kingdoms Seemed pretty upset with us.
Fluttershy_Neutral__The last time they all argued, they got so angry, They accidentally destroyed their whole village!
Fluttershy_Neutral__The message doesn't get across.
Fluttershy_Neutral__The place is yours, if you want to stay.
Fluttershy_Neutral__The pleats are uneven. the fabric looks like toile.
Fluttershy_Neutral__The rest is easy.
Fluttershy_Neutral__The squirrels told me a short cut they take To the kirin village.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Then count me in.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Then i was gonna bring it right back to you, honest.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Then i'm sorry zephyr, but i don't think you can live here.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Then, the land would be covered in darkness, for, eternity.
Fluttershy_Neutral__There has to be somepony more.
Fluttershy_Neutral__There he is!
Fluttershy_Neutral__There, there.
Fluttershy_Neutral__There.
Fluttershy_Neutral__They know what happened here!
Fluttershy_Neutral__They may do things a bit differently than we're used to, But that's no reason to be rude!
Fluttershy_Neutral__They ran away.
Fluttershy_Neutral__They're probably just as nervous as you are.
Fluttershy_Neutral__They're the only ones who can get them to stop spinning.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Things looked bleak.
Fluttershy_Neutral__This is a big project, so i'm happy to have Such experienced ponies working on it with me.
Fluttershy_Neutral__This is one expert i know i can trust to put the animals first.
Fluttershy_Neutral__This is the first vampire fruit bat i've ever me and.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Though, i would like to ask you all just one favor.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Three times?
Fluttershy_Neutral__To get things back on track, i called in a favor From an old friend. he'll be here any minute.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Too loud?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Try again.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Twilight is wonderful with magic.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Twilight!
Fluttershy_Neutral__Two more bites?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Uh huh.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Uh, applejack. it isn't as bad as we thought.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Uh, discord, you don't seem to be yourself today.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Uh, discord.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Um, excuse me, twilight.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Um, excuse me?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Um, hello there, i'm your teacher. I hope you enjoy class.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Um, i've noticed a couple of things.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Um, no thank you. We'll keep looking.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Um, no.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Um, princess celestia is taking us On an overnight goodwill tour of yakyakistan.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Um, twilight? we should probably get back there.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Um, we went to the store and got two cakes.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Um, what does it do?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Um, you don't know this about me But, i'm pretty good with animals.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Um, zecora is counting on me.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Um, zephyr?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Um.
Fluttershy_Neutral__W-what do you mean?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Wait!
Fluttershy_Neutral__Wait.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Wait.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Way to go.
Fluttershy_Neutral__We could um, try.
Fluttershy_Neutral__We don't?
Fluttershy_Neutral__We have no need for curtains at the sanctuary.
Fluttershy_Neutral__We know you're scared. We're here to help.
Fluttershy_Neutral__We need everyone in tip top shape for the coronation.
Fluttershy_Neutral__We'll continue this discussion when i get back!
Fluttershy_Neutral__We're different.
Fluttershy_Neutral__We, let them have part of the orchard?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Welcome to rarity for you.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Well, i hope you learned your lesson.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Well, i love the idea of some quiet time with my best friends.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Well, i'd definitely rather be myself anyway.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Well, i'm not satisfied.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Well, it is worth a try, isn't it?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Well, it might take some time for me to really understand their language.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Well, it's a game about who can be quiet the longest.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Well, it's just, what you're wearing.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Well, maybe i should get out of your mane so you can work.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Well, maybe if you stuck with it for more than a few weeks?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Well, no offense to your teaching methods twilight, But i think i may have a way to help rainbow.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Well, she desperately needs some bed rest.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Well, thank you all.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Well, um. it's just that if i'm blindfolded And somepony were to leap out in front of me, I'd never have the chance to defend myself.
Fluttershy_Neutral__What a lovely compliment.
Fluttershy_Neutral__What can i help you with?
Fluttershy_Neutral__What can i help you with?
Fluttershy_Neutral__What do you mean?
Fluttershy_Neutral__What facts are those?
Fluttershy_Neutral__What if instead of rounding them up.
Fluttershy_Neutral__What matters is how hard you tried.
Fluttershy_Neutral__What's his name?
Fluttershy_Neutral__What's wrong, twilight?
Fluttershy_Neutral__When i get to see all my little animal friends again.
Fluttershy_Neutral__When mom and dad told you to find someplace else to live, I don't think they meant here.
Fluttershy_Neutral__When the time comes, tank will leave and dig into the ground.
Fluttershy_Neutral__When they're young, a Mungtooth forms a tight bond with its caretaker.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Whenever i'm sad, a hug from angel bunny Always makes me feel better.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Why are you in mage meadowbrook's home?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Why not?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Why rarity, it's so lovely.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Why, of course!
Fluttershy_Neutral__Will you excuse us for a moment?
Fluttershy_Neutral__With adorable critters, in dire need of a safe place To lay their heads and.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Without thinking about how it might make them feel?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Won't you stay for some tea?
Fluttershy_Neutral__Yay.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Yay.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Yay.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Yay.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Yay.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Yeah, i can vouch for that.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Yes i am.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Yes it is.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Yes, we are just doing this for the ticket.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Yes.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Yes.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Yes.
Fluttershy_Neutral__Yes. i'll do it. i'll do anything for the animals!
Fluttershy_Neutral__You and your sister fell out of your nest and got separated.
Fluttershy_Neutral__You could spend the evening with spike and big mac.
Fluttershy_Neutral__You did this on your own.
Fluttershy_Neutral__You got this new fluttershy, this day is yours.
Fluttershy_Neutral__You have to. this is the night you look forward to all year.
Fluttershy_Neutral__You just made a bad decision.
Fluttershy_Neutral__You know, i wouldn't have gotten my cutie mark If it weren't for her.
Fluttershy_Neutral__You know, you're right.
Fluttershy_Neutral__You said books twice.
Fluttershy_Neutral__You seem pretty prepared to me.
Fluttershy_Neutral__You should also know better than to take a nap where your snoring can become a health hazard to other creatures.
Fluttershy_Neutral__You should take that as a yes.
Fluttershy_Neutral__You think so?
Fluttershy_Neutral__You won't be able to take care of anypony else.
Fluttershy_Neutral__You're excused.
Fluttershy_Neutral__You're right. i've been taking baby steps.
Fluttershy_Neutral__You're the best vet pony in equestria.
Fluttershy_Neutral__You, you really think so?
Fluttershy_Neutral__a friend who didn't come through.
Fluttershy_Neutral__ahem.
Fluttershy_Neutral__and a true inspiration.
Fluttershy_Neutral__and that's when i realized the mystical mask Was actually mage meadowbrook!
Fluttershy_Neutral__and then, they all lived happily ever after.
Fluttershy_Neutral__but remember, these flowers are for princess celestia.
Fluttershy_Neutral__but today, i learned that everypony's contribution is important, no matter how small.
Fluttershy_Neutral__come on out, little guy. it's okay.
Fluttershy_Neutral__don't worry philomena, I know what'll make you feel better.
Fluttershy_Neutral__dragonlord ember, how nice to see you.
Fluttershy_Neutral__have fun.
Fluttershy_Neutral__here in manehattan?
Fluttershy_Neutral__hi.
Fluttershy_Neutral__how can the whole town be counting on us If most ponies have never even heard of buckball?
Fluttershy_Neutral__i hope everything goes well.
Fluttershy_Neutral__i said, you don't have time to help.
Fluttershy_Neutral__i think it's worth a try.
Fluttershy_Neutral__i wrote that in icing on the top.
Fluttershy_Neutral__i'm a year older than you.
Fluttershy_Neutral__if you just keep your head high, do your best, and believe in yourself.
Fluttershy_Neutral__is that why you pick on spike? To make your friends think you're tough?
Fluttershy_Neutral__it seems very dangerous.
Fluttershy_Neutral__it's because of your friendship That i finally feel able to make my dream project a reality.
Fluttershy_Neutral__it's the only way they'll feel comfortable.
Fluttershy_Neutral__leave?
Fluttershy_Neutral__looks like A few other ponies had the same idea.
Fluttershy_Neutral__love it.
Fluttershy_Neutral__no.
Fluttershy_Neutral__oh, i'm sorry. uh, am i interrupting?
Fluttershy_Neutral__oh, no.
Fluttershy_Neutral__on one condition.
Fluttershy_Neutral__only the prettiest ones will do.
Fluttershy_Neutral__please excuse me.
Fluttershy_Neutral__rarity, put your coat on.
Fluttershy_Neutral__screaming and hollering.
Fluttershy_Neutral__still, when you think about it, the view is just as good a little further back like, inside your house.
Fluttershy_Neutral__that must scare you to the core!
Fluttershy_Neutral__they wished to become grown ups, then came here and caused some kind of trouble.
Fluttershy_Neutral__till they feel ready to take on the world.
Fluttershy_Neutral__we can't play without him.
Fluttershy_Neutral__we learned that you should take your friends' worries seriously.
Fluttershy_Neutral__well I guess the opposite of what i'm good at is being in small spaces is.
Fluttershy_Neutral__what i'm trying to say is.
Fluttershy_Neutral__yes, but.
Fluttershy_Neutral__you need to cover up, because no one has complimented your dress!
Fluttershy_Neutral__you won't believe what i found at the edge of the everfree forest.
Fluttershy_Sad Angry__You left me alone in the woods!
Fluttershy_Sad Anxious_Noisy_And I'm only doing it because Rarity told me I must. I must! I must!
Fluttershy_Sad Anxious_Noisy_But, we didn't even get a chance to say goodbye.
Fluttershy_Sad Anxious_Noisy_Now whenever i'm in a tiny room, it's all i can think about! I was so worried he felt alone and forgotten.
Fluttershy_Sad Anxious_Noisy_Oh yes, best time ever.
Fluttershy_Sad Anxious_Noisy_Oh, another dead end.
Fluttershy_Sad Anxious_Noisy_Sombra's going to force us To fight our way through our friends?
Fluttershy_Sad Anxious_Noisy_or angel, or anypony forced to do that monster's bidding!
Fluttershy_Sad Anxious_Very Noisy_Oh, no.
Fluttershy_Sad Anxious__I guess i owe everypony an apology.
Fluttershy_Sad Anxious__I might have taken my salespony characters a little, too far.
Fluttershy_Sad Anxious__If, everypony likes me again.
Fluttershy_Sad Anxious__What if we don't talk as much?
Fluttershy_Sad Shouting__Can't we all just, get along!?
Fluttershy_Sad_Noisy_But i put my trust in the wrong ponies.
Fluttershy_Sad_Noisy_But it's better to do it now than during the game against appleloosa.
Fluttershy_Sad_Noisy_Can i tell you something?
Fluttershy_Sad_Noisy_Everypony will be a lot safer With me and my mean mouth locked away.
Fluttershy_Sad_Noisy_I feel just awful that i made you feel so awful.
Fluttershy_Sad_Noisy_I must.
Fluttershy_Sad_Noisy_I really am a doormat.
Fluttershy_Sad_Noisy_I really didn't!
Fluttershy_Sad_Noisy_I thought we were friends!
Fluttershy_Sad_Noisy_I'm here.
Fluttershy_Sad_Noisy_I'm moving back to cloudsdale. i don't know what's wrong But, i can't seem to make anypony laugh.
Fluttershy_Sad_Noisy_I'm so, so sorry, can you ever forgive me?
Fluttershy_Sad_Noisy_I'm the monster.
Fluttershy_Sad_Noisy_In fact, i wasn't helping you at all by being nice.
Fluttershy_Sad_Noisy_It's all my fault.
Fluttershy_Sad_Noisy_Look at me.
Fluttershy_Sad_Noisy_Me too.
Fluttershy_Sad_Noisy_More than anything.
Fluttershy_Sad_Noisy_No. you're right.
Fluttershy_Sad_Noisy_Nopony here will deny.
Fluttershy_Sad_Noisy_Oh hey, twilight.
Fluttershy_Sad_Noisy_Oh no, she's already gone, isn't she?
Fluttershy_Sad_Noisy_Oh, fluttershy, you're such a loudmouth.
Fluttershy_Sad_Noisy_Oh, okay.

Gabby_Neutral_Noisy_Um, i don't know. maybe it means my purpose is uh, Helping zecora with potions.
Gabby_Neutral_Noisy_i don't know if you've heard But, griffons can be a little bit, unfriendly.
Gabby_Neutral_Noisy_you can't mean.
Gabby_Neutral_Very Noisy_And if they do, it's not, y'know, the good kind of attention.
Gabby_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'd do anything for any old griffon in need.
Gabby_Neutral_Very Noisy_Most griffons don't pay much attention to each other.
Gabby_Neutral_Very Noisy_which always makes me feel different from the other griffons.
Gabby_Neutral__I better take care of that before i forget.
Gabby_Neutral__That was the first thing i tried.
Gabby_Neutral__Well, i was really glad i helped you feel happier.
Gabby_Sad Anxious_Noisy_I can't believe it. i, i i won't believe it.
Gabby_Sad_Noisy_But it just always seemed like the harder I tried, the less I fit in.
Gabby_Sad_Noisy_I couldn't bear you three thinking you failed After you tried so hard to help.
Gabby_Sad_Noisy_I know you all tried your very best, But i guess griffons and cutie marks just don't mix.
Gabby_Sad_Noisy_Maybe, i don't even have a special purpose.
Gabby_Sad_Noisy_Thanks for trying.
Gabby_Sad_Noisy_i'm sorry i wasn't honest with you.
Gabby_Sad_Very Noisy_I guess the one thing i'm really not that good at, Is faking things.

Gabby_Sad_Very Noisy_I'll just wing my way back to griffonstone.
Gabby_Sad__But, i didn't do it to make myself feel better.
Gabby_Sad__Sure i was disappointed.

Gallus_Annoyed_Very Noisy_We don't!
Gallus_Annoyed_Very Noisy_You're the one using these artifacts To drain magic from equestria.

Gallus_Neutral_Very Noisy_But i realized i had to face my fear and i found the way out.
Gallus_Neutral_Very Noisy_Gotcha!
Gallus_Neutral_Very Noisy_Hey yona!
Gallus_Neutral_Very Noisy_Hey! this is just like chapter twelve in Kanthaka's facts and artifacts, from twilight's class.
Gallus_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm a bit rusty on pony history.
Gallus_Neutral_Very Noisy_If you want the real scoop, there's only one place to go.
Gallus_Neutral_Very Noisy_Ok, that's horrifying.
Gallus_Neutral_Very Noisy_What? i've been studying.
Gallus_Neutral_Very Noisy_With other students? this is equestria!
Gallus_Neutral__Ah ha!
Gallus_Neutral__And we never, ever, ever get homework.
Gallus_Neutral__Better than i thought.
Gallus_Neutral__Come on, let it go.
Gallus_Neutral__Except maybe yours smolder.
Gallus_Neutral__Guys, stop it.
Gallus_Neutral__I had no idea our teachers were actually cool.
Gallus_Neutral__I'm so gonna fail.
Gallus_Neutral__Is that even a thing?
Gallus_Neutral__It was kinda crazy genius, They showed us what not to do so we'd figure out what we should do.
Gallus_Neutral__Kinda.
Gallus_Neutral__Leave 'em hanging?
Gallus_Neutral__Let me start by telling you we don't get homework, And we only do field trips.
Gallus_Neutral__Let's give it a try.
Gallus_Neutral__No big. those fish weren't even a thing.
Gallus_Neutral__Now that we've saved equestria, We figured we were done with school.
Gallus_Neutral__Playing together! Singing together! Even laughing together!
Gallus_Neutral__So, to recap, your holiday is about smashing things, And family.
Gallus_Neutral__That's kinda our fault.
Gallus_Neutral__That's what real heroes looks like!
Gallus_Neutral__The one time of year when griffons are Nice to each other.
Gallus_Neutral__This is your test, he isn't really here.
Gallus_Neutral__What are those?
Gallus_Neutral__What? we have a test. i don't know every detail About every adventure the professors went on like you do.
Gallus_Neutral__Which idea do you like best?
Gallus_Neutral__Yeah, it's been like this all day.
Gallus_Neutral__Your Majesty.
Gallus_Neutral__or cupcakes.
Gallus_Neutral__she's here.
Gallus_Sad Annoyed_Noisy_With your stories about sharing, and kindness, And getting together with everycreature That you care about?
Gallus_Sad Anxious__That's the opposite of what all your holidays mean.
Gallus_Sad_Noisy_Because i don't have a family.
Gallus_Sad_Noisy_I hated seeing all you fighting and and blaming each other.
Gallus_Sad_Noisy_I just figured if i made a mess Our teachers would make us stay to clean up.
Gallus_Sad_Noisy_I put goo powder in the fire of friendship.
Gallus_Sad_Noisy_That's why i didn't confess.
Gallus_Sad_Noisy_When headmare twilight threatened to cancel Winter break, that meant i would get to Be with all of you.
Gallus_Sad_Noisy_and mostly just try not to yell at each other.
Gallus_Sad_Noisy_i felt like i never had a place in griffonstone.
Gallus_Sad__Don't worry, you won't have to tell our teachers.
Gallus_Sad__I can't keep all of you from the happiness of your homes And families just because i feel bad.
Gallus_Sad__I will.
Gallus_Sad__I'm sorry.
Gallus_Sad__No.
Gallus_Sad__Yeah, It was me.
Gallus_Sad__Yeah.
Gallus_Sad__be together a little longer.
Gallus_Sarcastic_Noisy_And we care because?
Gallus_Sarcastic_Noisy_Aww, are we not being sweet and friendly enough for you, pony?
Gallus_Sarcastic_Noisy_Could've fooled me.
Gallus_Sarcastic_Noisy_How long does that last?
Gallus_Sarcastic_Noisy_How? by boring him into surrender?
Gallus_Sarcastic_Noisy_Just a friendly discussion about the magic of friendship Amongst, friends.
Gallus_Sarcastic_Noisy_No, i just figured i'd randomly stand here And see how many ponies would walk into me.
Gallus_Sarcastic_Noisy_Since friendship just isn't in our nature, what's the point?
Gallus_Sarcastic_Noisy_Two whole weeks without classes, How will ocellus survive?
Gallus_Sarcastic_Very Noisy_Can you tell me, everything i need to know about friendship?
Gallus_Sarcastic_Very Noisy_Hello, oh magical equestrian tree.
Gallus_Smug_Noisy_Unless you're too scared.
Gallus_Smug_Very Noisy_Guess our friendship is pretty magical after all.

Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_But i knew if there was critters living there, There must be something to eat.

Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_How long you had those new chompers, auntie applesauce?
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_I ain't going anywhere anytime soon.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_I ain't seen hide nor hair of you's all day.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_I don't know.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_I had never seen anything That bore this kind of colorful fruit.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_I have a history of excellent storytellin'.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_I looked out at the water this morning And i felt the same terrifying aches and pains i always do.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_I should probably do it.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_I travelled down this river as a filly, and I know it like the back of my hoof.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_I was s'posed to keep an eye on your sister, But she was slipperier than an apple seed.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_I wouldn't miss it for all the tea in canterlot.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_I'd forget my mane if it wasn't attached to my head.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_I'm gonna be busier than a worm in a rotten tomato Trying to get everything ready.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_I've had a hankerin' for these all day!
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_If thou asketh me, er thou two art, eh okay eth in my book.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_If you're so fretified about work.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Indeedy, and i'm looking forward to making more at this one.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Is that a mummified pony that just leaped out at you?
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_It is not to say i don't wish i was still young and spry and confident, but.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_It is riskiest, scariest, darn fooled thing i ever did do!
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_It was dark and musty, and i won't lie, it was scary.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_It was my second year here in ponyville.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_It's like she thought you used magic.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_It's nightmare night, remember?
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Just the idea of swimming makes my whole body ache.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Long ago, when i was a little pony.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Meh, don't worry, child.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Nope. i ain't seen it.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Now everypony just sit on back and leave the steering to your old Granny Smith.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Now i've been doing this ever since i was a little pony.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Now mind you, we were cautioned about the forest, And we knew that it was not fit to enter.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Now step aside, youngin'.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Now when i was a filly.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Now where'd you all get to?
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Now, Applejack, I taught you better than to question your elder ponies.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Now, it ain't about the Speed, youngin. It's about quality.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Now, listen here, troops.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Now, stick an apple in my mouth and roast my rump!
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Now, while you sweep, i'll get to.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Now, who here still wants to hear about the apple blight?
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Of course I meant to take us through it.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Of course.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Oh i'll never tell.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, i'm sure everypony is and i do mean everypony.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, quit your fussing.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, such a shame we don't live closer To all your second cousins.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, we ventured far and wide, Collecting new seeds and selling old. But my pa was the finest seed collector in all equestria.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Or no zap-apple jam.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Or what about six layer bean dip?
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Perfect as a piccadilly pear.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Ponies go in, but they never come out!
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Praline!
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Seems like more work of the great seedling to me.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_She won't come out of a funk this funky Til her big sister gets back.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Since our last family reunion.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_So be warned, pickle-pear. There's a whole mess of steps in this process, And you gots to get each one of them just right.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_That is why every juice season, all of ponyville lines up At sweet apple acres and first come is first served.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_That's how we figured out your sister had the appetite Of a full grown stallion.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_The apple blight's been awful, and if we don't get more spray, Juice season'll be shorter than a dwarf crab apple tree.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_The scariest maze that there ever was.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_The two of us entered the seven legged race every reunion.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Them nuts sure do smell good.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Then each year, i paid close attention To the signs of the zap-apples' special harvesting times.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Then, one day, the smith family found themselves In the most brilliant, most grand, most magnificent Of all cities.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Then, ponies started coming to our farm from far and wide Just to get a taste of my zap-apple jam.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_They don't make them like they used to.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Things were very different here in ponyville, 'cause there was no ponyville!
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_This is pretty close to my color as a youngin'.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Thought it'd be nice to award the winner of the big race the ribbon From when we hosted the very first social!
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Uh, big mac?
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Uncle apple strudel wants me to pay him a visit.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Unexpected adventure is good for the soul.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_We got the whole family together this time around.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_We need it for the apple family haunted maze.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_We quickly found that land near the everfree forest, And we built our first home.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_We'll take the whole case!
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Well that's nice, but i don't know what in blazes You two are talking about.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Well the social's always had a pretty loose Definition of what constimatutes a sister.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Well, back in the old days we used to use a sap from a sugarpine tree to glue things together.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Well, bust my buttons.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Well, i wasn't always this way.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Well, nopony told me i actually had to knot the end of the thread.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Well, that was considerate. But don't you worry, flibberty gibbert. I'll be back in time to make that jam.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_What?
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_When, lo and behold, She stopped to look at my pa's seed collection.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Who knows if they'll all be able to make the next one?
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Who'd have thought that glass jars needed talking to?
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Why, when i was little, ponies didn't come that purty.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Y'all take care as well.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Yeah they'd better! i need you to go to town.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Yeah, never did find them teeth in all those jars.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_Yeah. i was gonna get my dentures cleaned Before y'all showed up.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_You be sure and take care now, applebloom.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_You could maybe do the social with one of them instead.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_You got yourself a deal. you are in charge.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Noisy_You just gotta give everypony a chance to actually make them.

Granny Smith_Neutral_Very Noisy_I don't see why not. come on, big mac! toss her this way!
Granny Smith_Neutral_Very Noisy_I learned that you got to be extra friendly with the bees. Otherwise, their honey won't taste rightly sweet to mix in with the zap-apples.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Very Noisy_I never said being a highdiver was a smart decision.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Very Noisy_I turned, and there before me stood, the timber wolves.
Granny Smith_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'll go take a look.

Luna_Neutral_Noisy_also truth be told, celestia and i had fun today.

Luna_Neutral__But when you wake, The thing that frightens you most will still exist.
Luna_Neutral__But with each passing moment he grows stronger still.
Luna_Neutral__Did you, talk to yourself?
Luna_Neutral__Especially you. you have all suffered so much because of me.

Luna_Neutral__Goodness, Twilight. Are you all right?

Luna_Neutral__I assure you, i am more than capable of handling All of celestia's.
Luna_Neutral__I cannot allow the tantabus to escape into the real world.
Luna_Neutral__I have been helped time and time again By six very special ponies.
Luna_Neutral__I suggest you share your concerns with them.
Luna_Neutral__I too have a sister who often shines more brightly than me.
Luna_Neutral__I understand what you are going through, sweetie belle.
Luna_Neutral__In what other ways may we experience it?
Luna_Neutral__Including accept your help.
Luna_Neutral__Indeed.
Luna_Neutral__Is the headless horse Really what frightens you the most?
Luna_Neutral__It is beyond even our understanding.

Luna_Neutral__Of course.
Luna_Neutral__Of course. i will do anything to end this.

Luna_Neutral__Oh, i wouldn't say that.
Luna_Neutral__Our magic cannot just disappear into thin air.
Luna_Neutral__She has no power in the realm of sleep.
Luna_Neutral__Should we tell her that we've cleared out our royal suites so she and Spike can move in?
Luna_Neutral__So um.
Luna_Neutral__Somepony must keep it safe.
Luna_Neutral__Something wrong?
Luna_Neutral__That power will belong solely to tirek.
Luna_Neutral__That things do indeed get better.
Luna_Neutral__The crowds have already started to gather.
Luna_Neutral__The map was wise to send you starlight.
Luna_Neutral__There is nothing my sister can do.
Luna_Neutral__Thou even got the bells right.
Luna_Neutral__Thus it is my duty to come into your dreams.
Luna_Neutral__We always knew that whatever adversity you faced, you and your friends would find your way through it together.
Luna_Neutral__We believe, it happened when cerberus has left his post at the gates.
Luna_Neutral__We have been locked away for a thousand years.
Luna_Neutral__We hope you'll come and visit us in Silver Shoals.
Luna_Neutral__Well, that is the same as worrying about who you are.
Luna_Neutral__What do you think?
Luna_Neutral__With the help of your friends, of course.
Luna_Neutral__Yes.
Luna_Neutral__You are fortunate to have them as friends.
Luna_Neutral__You can be sure they'll fit you to a tee.
Luna_Neutral__You know as well as i that this was not a dream, but a vision.
Luna_Neutral__You misunderstand.
Luna_Neutral__You must journey to the dragonlands And see what is expected of you.
Luna_Neutral__You were mistaken, but i hope not disappointed.
Luna_Neutral__a mailpony took it from me.
Luna_Neutral__it's your dream.
Luna_Neutral__me.
Luna_Neutral__oh.
Luna_Neutral__one more thing. we're leaving you in charge of raising the sun and moon while we're gone.
Luna_Neutral__real life is happening out here!
Luna_Neutral__so i could use some real world downtime.
Luna_Neutral__this?
Luna_Neutral__we should probably go help her.
Luna_Neutral__we're ready to do whatever we can.
Luna_Neutral__we've spent more than enough time in the throne room.
Luna_Neutral__you all make it look so easy.
Luna_Neutral__you know, being with your sister all the time is hard but.
Luna_Neutral__you taught me to look for those when i was a filly.
Luna_Sad Anxious_Noisy_I thought all you had to do was smile and be adored All the time, but i was wrong.
Luna_Sad Anxious_Noisy_There is so much more to it than that.
Luna_Sad_Noisy_I missed you so much, big sister.
Luna_Sad_Noisy_It will be back to infect your dreams the next time you sleep.
Luna_Sad_Noisy_No, children, no.
Luna_Sad_Noisy_Very well, then. be that way!
Luna_Sad_Noisy_We won't even bother with the traditional royal farewell!
Luna_Sad_Noisy_You no longer have reason to fear us.
Luna_Sad_Noisy_guess we have the same thing on both of our lists then.
Luna_Sad_Noisy_if she were here.
Luna_Sad_Very Noisy_But it seems i have not learned my lesson.
Luna_Sad_Very Noisy_For now i have only made you suffer more!
Luna_Sad_Very Noisy_I am no better now than i was then.
Luna_Sad_Very Noisy_I failed.
Luna_Sad_Very Noisy_Leave me be, twilight sparkle.
Luna_Sad_Very Noisy_To make sure i, never forgave myself, for How much equestria suffered because of me!
Luna_Sad_Very Noisy_i-i mean, nay, children, Wait.
Luna_Sad_Very Noisy_to punish myself for the evil i caused as nightmare moon!
Luna_Sad__I am so sorry, my friends.
Luna_Sad__i'm sorry i said those things before.
Luna_Sad__sometimes it's just, tough being the little sister.
Luna_Sarcastic_Noisy_Like smiling is so hard.
Luna_Sarcastic_Noisy_if you think it's worth, discussing.
Luna_Sarcastic__Forgive me if i withhold my enthusiasm.
Luna_Sarcastic__Smiling and being adored by everypony?
Luna_Shouting_Very Noisy_Ponies!
Luna_Smug_Noisy_Oh, i knew today would be easy, But i didn't think it would be that easy.
Luna_Surprised Annoyed__That wasn't the bad news?!
Luna_Surprised__oh! the sun and the moon together, at the same time!?
Luna_Tired_Noisy_Goodlight, starnight.
Luna_Tired_Noisy_Hmm? oh, yes. i'm just going to turn in then.
Luster Dawn_Anxious__And I don't think there's anything wrong with that. In fact, I think it's better.
Luster Dawn_Confused__So, the coronation wasn't a disaster and your friendships just faded away over time?
Luster Dawn_Confused__you didn't grow apart?
Luster Dawn_Happy__And you've been wonderful. I've enjoyed every moment at the School of Magic.
Luster Dawn_Neutral_Noisy_I know you and your friends accomplished a lot together, but that was so long ago and.
Luster Dawn_Neutral_Very Noisy_Your Majesty.
Luster Dawn_Neutral__And it's not the work. I could spend weeks in the library doing research.
Luster Dawn_Neutral__And this is the Council of Friendship?
Luster Dawn_Neutral__But that's just it, I don't want to make friends.
Luster Dawn_Neutral__But, I'm just not sure it's, the right place for me.
Luster Dawn_Neutral__But, I've been so focused on my studies, I wouldn't know where to start.
Luster Dawn_Neutral__Exactly. You moved away, your friends didn't care, and that was that.
Luster Dawn_Neutral__Friendship looks like more of a distraction than anything else and ultimately, a waste of time.
Luster Dawn_Neutral__I guess, if they don't have to fade away, maybe making friends isn't the waste of time I thought.
Luster Dawn_Neutral__I just assumed that since you all aren't together all the time now.
Luster Dawn_Neutral__I never thought about friendship being something to work at, and I don't mind work.
Luster Dawn_Neutral__I want to accomplish as much as you have someday.
Luster Dawn_Neutral__I was hoping to set up an independent course of study.
Luster Dawn_Neutral__I'm not so sure.
Luster Dawn_Neutral__I-it's just that, there's a lot of focus on making friends.
Luster Dawn_Neutral__Okay, I get it now.
Luster Dawn_Neutral__Plus, if friendships ultimately fade, why even make them in the first place?
Luster Dawn_Neutral__So, even though everything changed, and you moved away from your friends.
Luster Dawn_Neutral__That's what you're all doing here?
Luster Dawn_Neutral__Your coronation was such a disaster that you and your friends never really recovered.
Luster Dawn_Neutral__and that's why you all drifted apart.
Luster Dawn_Neutral__as far as I can see, you rule by yourself now.
Lyra Heartstrings_Annoyed_Noisy_Well, i think vanilla strawberry cream is overused!
Lyra Heartstrings_Neutral_Noisy_I guess i never thought of it that way. thanks, spike.
Lyra_Angry_Noisy_Are you saying our whole friendship was based on a lie!?
Lyra_Annoyed Confused__What, are you, talking about?
Lyra_Annoyed_Noisy_And you're not the only one with a secret, y'know.

Lyra_Happy__It's sort of thrilling to reveal your deepest darkest secrets!
Lyra_Neutral_Noisy_Uh, i think it's some sort of bugbear.
Lyra_Neutral_Noisy_With you by my side, i knew we'd get it done in time.
Lyra_Neutral_Very Noisy_There's some monster attacking ponyville or something.
Lyra_Sad__None of that was real!?
Lyra_Smug__I cooked them all and ate them! All of them!
Lyra_Smug__You know those expensive, imported oats you were saving for a special occasion?

Ma Hooffield_Neutral_Very Noisy_They know what they did.
Ma Hooffield_Neutral_Very Noisy_We have, a mccolt problem.
Ma Hooffield_Neutral_Very Noisy_We thought the mccolts rubbed ya the wrong way.
Ma Hooffield_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, because the mccolts are just plain rotten.
Ma Hooffield_Neutral_Very Noisy_Were you serious about apologizin'?

Neighsay_Annoyed_Noisy_Changing the rules, for them! it simply won't work!
Neighsay_Annoyed_Noisy_Classes, won't start at all.
Neighsay_Annoyed_Noisy_How's this school gonna be any different from last time?

Neighsay_Annoyed_Noisy_The school was disorganized! The teachers unqualified!
Neighsay_Annoyed_Noisy_The way it always should have been.
Neighsay_Annoyed_Noisy_This act of aggression against ponies.

Ocellus_Anxious_Noisy_Oh, no! i wanna come!
Ocellus_Anxious_Noisy_Oops.
Ocellus_Anxious_Noisy_Sandbar. you know that's not the same tree, right?
Ocellus_Anxious_Noisy_Silverstream! somehow i missed a class all year and the final is today!
Ocellus_Anxious_Noisy_So if neither one of them confesses, that means.
Ocellus_Anxious_Noisy_Um, professors?
Ocellus_Anxious_Noisy_We know it's too early to pick the teacher of the month.
Ocellus_Anxious_Noisy_We'll be here forever!
Ocellus_Anxious_Noisy_Where are you going? You're not, skipping are you?
Ocellus_Anxious_Noisy_if only we hadn't gone home for summer break.
Ocellus_Anxious_Noisy_my meditation garden is ruined!
Ocellus_Anxious_Noisy_what happened?
Ocellus_Anxious_Very Noisy_But if we don't try, we could lose magic forever.
Ocellus_Anxious_Very Noisy_Hurry, grab the artifacts!
Ocellus_Anxious_Very Noisy_It looks like magic!
Ocellus_Anxious_Very Noisy_Oops! sorry!
Ocellus_Anxious_Very Noisy_We should probably get back to studying for the test.
Ocellus_Anxious_Very Noisy_Which way do we go.
Ocellus_Anxious_Very Noisy_if i don't pass, i can't graduate!
Ocellus_Anxious__Does that mean you're going to send us back to our homes?
Ocellus_Anxious__Maybe we can't really change that much.
Ocellus_Anxious__Maybe we could've saved the tree.
Ocellus_Anxious__Me? but i didn't!
Ocellus_Anxious__Rockhoof isn't a bad guy.
Ocellus_Anxious__The last two.
Ocellus_Anxious__Uh sorry thorax, it was an emergency!
Ocellus_Anxious__Why do you look like that?
Ocellus_Anxious__Why? if sandbar's turned his back on us, every other pony probably has too.
Ocellus_Anxious__i'm just glad the tree isn't here to see this.
Ocellus_Confused_Noisy_I'm sorry, what?
Ocellus_Confused_Noisy_What are you doing?
Ocellus_Confused_Very Noisy_Wait, what did you say about me?
Ocellus_Happy_Noisy_And i can't wait to do it all again this year.
Ocellus_Happy_Noisy_But we made our own traditions!
Ocellus_Happy_Noisy_But, we'd like you to consider rainbow dash, and applejack.
Ocellus_Happy_Noisy_Dive into some holiday punch.
Ocellus_Happy_Noisy_Even better!
Ocellus_Happy_Noisy_Families start the holidays by putting the tree up!
Ocellus_Happy_Noisy_Here's a guide to help you Enjoy this celebration of pony history.
Ocellus_Happy_Noisy_I remembered it from class, Princess twilight's history of pre equestrian friendships.
Ocellus_Happy_Noisy_I wish the other changelings could meet you all.
Ocellus_Happy_Noisy_I'm ready!
Ocellus_Happy_Noisy_It's ok yona! You like flying, remember?
Ocellus_Happy_Noisy_Maybe i can make friends with it.
Ocellus_Happy_Noisy_Nope! They're all legendary magical artifacts!
Ocellus_Happy_Noisy_Pillows, how nice!
Ocellus_Happy_Noisy_That's twice the learning!
Ocellus_Happy_Noisy_The castle is going to be so much more comfy.
Ocellus_Happy_Noisy_To the helm of yksler!
Ocellus_Happy_Noisy_Yes! one down, five to go!
Ocellus_Happy_Noisy_Yona, you're really strong.
Ocellus_Happy_Noisy_You're the tree of harmony!
Ocellus_Happy_Noisy_the tree! where did you find it?
Ocellus_Happy_Noisy_welcome to the traditions and fun of hearth's warming.
Ocellus_Happy_Very Noisy_Actually, i remember that too.
Ocellus_Happy_Very Noisy_Thanks!
Ocellus_Happy_Very Noisy_Wow. i've never stood on a cloud before.
Ocellus_Happy__Oh yes! It's our favorite holiday!
Ocellus_Happy__Wow. they're amazing.
Ocellus_Happy__that's a great idea!
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_Always?
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_Any enemies that saw him put down their weapons in peace.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_At least now they're agreeing on something.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_But why did you bring us here, headmare twilight?
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_Cozy must have linked these artifacts To act like a mystical magnet.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_Don't worry.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_Eh, we may not have done everything Exactly the way you do.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_I got some help and guidance from the counselor At our feelings forum back home.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_I guess we should tell somepony there's a giant magical hole In the library.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_I read ahead in equestrian cultures and camaraderie.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_I think we've gone in the same circle five times.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_I'm a little confused about teamwork now.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_I'm just the distraction.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_I'm not sure pony stories work that way.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_I've never been on a field trip before.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_I, think his artifact must be in one of these suits of armor.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_In our book, it says yksler was an honorable yak warrior.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_It did say it needed us.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_It does make sense.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_It says they teach, the same lessons Of competing schools in half the time.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_It's for creatures to look at as they honor the tree's memory in quiet thought and contemplation.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_Light it up.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_Me too!
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_Me too.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_No, the pillars grew the tree.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_Oh! is that why you put their fire of friendship On top of the tree? To help us remember their unity?
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_Only positive energy will bloom here.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_Or maybe she just wants to help us keep our minds off of how scary it is that magic's disappearing.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_Our teachers are a little different than i expected.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_Sometimes, when i'm scared to try something new, i whistle.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_Sorry but, they said they want you to go in next.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_Sorry, thorax.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_That's right!
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_The castle of the two sisters.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_The elements of harmony.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_Um, apples?
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_Used a spell to trap discord in stone sleep, For hundreds of moons.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_Volume seven.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_We just studied all about how princess celestia and luna.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_We need to work fast, and together.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_We were studying friendship's effect on history but then.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_What are dragons good at?
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_Whoa. that was weird.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_You must do something in the winter for fun.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_You should have told yona that.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_You're not nearly as strange as the stories say.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_Your aunt's and uncle's children? You know, part of your family.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_and to finish celebrating, you can build a fire.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_i think we should turn this cave into a place For creatures to reflect on the tree's true gift.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_it was. but when we used the broken parts to build something new, this happened.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_just before bed, everypony exchanges gifts.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_or not.
Ocellus_Neutral_Noisy_we ran away to be together Right above this spot, the castle of the two sisters!
Ocellus_Neutral_Very Noisy_Attracting all the magic in equestria into that orb!
Ocellus_Neutral_Very Noisy_I guess magic is back.
Ocellus_Neutral_Very Noisy_Sure, though that would probably cause a magical Feedback loop and destroy the whole school.
Ocellus_Neutral_Very Noisy_Technically, there's a magical component When silversteam and i transform.
Ocellus_Neutral_Very Noisy_Thanks yona. this fountain is heavier than i thought.
Ocellus_Neutral_Very Noisy_That's ok.
Ocellus_Neutral_Very Noisy_Your friends can change into creatures that do!
Ocellus_Neutral_Very Noisy_what would headmare twilight want?
Ocellus_Neutral__And sing carols.
Ocellus_Neutral__But our professors found six keys And unlocked the box.
Ocellus_Neutral__It's a puckwudgie!
Ocellus_Neutral__It's uh, kinda messy.
Ocellus_Neutral__None of us are.
Ocellus_Neutral__Not me.
Ocellus_Neutral__Oh, you're teasing us again right?
Ocellus_Neutral__Oops, sorry.
Ocellus_Neutral__She gave our hive very clear instructions.
Ocellus_Neutral__That's why we're studying together.
Ocellus_Neutral__They've taught us how powerful love and the Magic of Friendship truly is!
Ocellus_Neutral__We can't let them stand alone! We're their friends! They need us!
Ocellus_Neutral__Well, since headmare twilight shared it with us last year.
Ocellus_Neutral__sandbar?
Ocellus_Neutral__thirsty?
Ocellus_Sad Anxious_Noisy_Maybe my past was so horrible, it's still inside me just waiting to come out again.
Ocellus_Sad Anxious_Noisy_That's a horrible story!
Ocellus_Sad Anxious_Noisy_how can we remember the tree, if it's totally gone!?
Ocellus_Sad Anxious_Noisy_why couldn't you have been more careful?
Ocellus_Sad_Noisy_Go away.
Ocellus_Sad_Noisy_I can't.
Ocellus_Sad_Noisy_I guess the tree really is gone.
Ocellus_Sad_Noisy_It's me! i'm hideous!
Ocellus_Sad_Noisy_That's so sad!
Ocellus_Sad_Noisy_Why would you ruin things for us?
Ocellus_Surprised Anxious_Very Noisy_The school is haunted!
Octavia_Annoyed_Noisy_Thanks, But i'm not sure that's appropriate for a wedding, is it?
Octavia_Annoyed_Noisy_Ugh, all these wedding songs are so, Standard.
Octavia_Anxious_Very Noisy_Stop! i'm going to be late for the wedding!
Octavia_Anxious__A monster attack!? blast!
Octavia_Anxious__I'm performing at the ceremony this afternoon, And i still haven't sorted out what to play.
Octavia_Happy__That's more like it!
Octavia_Neutral_Noisy_Do we know what they're on about?
Octavia_Neutral_Noisy_Something like that might work.
Octavia_Neutral_Very Noisy_I want matilda and cranky's wedding to be special.

Party Favor_Anxious_Noisy_It's only a matter of time!
Party Favor_Anxious_Noisy_She's headed for the pass. If she makes it into those mountains, we'll never find her.
Party Favor_Anxious_Noisy_We thought starlight had given it to us, but now.
Party Favor_Anxious_Noisy_You will all accept our way!
Party Favor_Anxious_Noisy_Your friend has accepted our way!
Party Favor_Anxious_Very Noisy_I love all of.
Party Favor_Anxious_Very Noisy_They tried to break me, they wouldn't stop talking about how different they are, And that somehow makes their friendship stronger.
Party Favor_Anxious__But you mean, actually having it put back on?
Party Favor_Anxious__I just wanted to remember what it was like.
Party Favor_Anxious__That seems extreme.
Party Favor_Confused_Noisy_Uh, hey starlight. what are you doing here?

Pharynx_Annoyed Sarcastic_Noisy_It sounds like your lame feelings forum is for talking About me behind my back.
Pharynx_Annoyed_Noisy_At least i used to.
Pharynx_Annoyed_Noisy_I could've sent that thing packing before.
Pharynx_Annoyed_Noisy_I don't take advice from ponies.
Pharynx_Annoyed_Noisy_Leaving. i'm done with all of you.
Pharynx_Annoyed_Noisy_Now we sit around talking about our feelings so much You can't even stop a maulwurf From eating all your pretty plants.
Pharynx_Annoyed_Noisy_Stay away from me or i'll do to you what i did to the vines.
Pharynx_Annoyed_Noisy_The hive looked better with holes.
Pharynx_Annoyed_Noisy_What a ridiculous comparison. we are nothing alike.
Pharynx_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Get out of here! Let me handle this!
Pharynx_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Yeah, with the rest of the swarm.
Pharynx_Annoyed__But they were lurking on our grounds!
Pharynx_Annoyed__I liked the old days better.

Pharynx_Neutral_Noisy_Doubt it.
Pharynx_Neutral_Noisy_Except for thorax. He was a little weak.
Pharynx_Neutral_Noisy_Hey, do you guys want to hear the story About how i used to make thorax hit himself?
Pharynx_Neutral_Noisy_I captured these trespassers.
Pharynx_Neutral_Noisy_I love the hive.
Pharynx_Neutral_Noisy_I never said that.
Pharynx_Neutral_Noisy_In the old days, i would have already feasted on their love.
Pharynx_Neutral_Noisy_Lucky for me, you didn't give up on me.
Pharynx_Neutral_Noisy_No.
Pharynx_Neutral_Noisy_Really? because i thought you said i was a lost cause And you were going to tell thorax he should kick me out.
Pharynx_Neutral_Noisy_Really? hmm. maybe you two do understand me.
Pharynx_Neutral_Noisy_That's ridiculous.
Pharynx_Neutral_Noisy_The changelings used to be a fearsome swarm.
Pharynx_Neutral_Noisy_The hive is the thing i care about most.
Pharynx_Neutral_Noisy_The only thing i take from you is breakfast.
Pharynx_Neutral_Noisy_Thorax! remember when we were young And i made you hit yourself?
Pharynx_Neutral_Noisy_Well, i couldn't just let it attack you!

Pharynx_Neutral_Noisy_Whatever. it doesn't matter.
Pharynx_Neutral_Noisy_Why would i want that?
Pharynx_Neutral_Very Noisy_Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself?
Pharynx_Neutral__I don't even know why they're here.

Pharynx_Neutral__I thought it went great.
Pharynx_Neutral__They're a safety hazard. An enemy could hide in them or use them as weapons.
Pharynx_Neutral__Wow, so you're both losers.
Pharynx_Sad_Noisy_Even if i do care about the hive I, obviously don't have a place there anymore.
Pharynx_Sarcastic_Noisy_But i guess now, we'll just try to lead it away And hope that keeps us safe.
Pharynx_Sarcastic_Noisy_Well i'm sorry if i don't get excited about pretty flowers And feelings circles.
Pharynx_Surprised_Noisy_What are you doing here?

Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I don't know, but rainbow dash is our friend!
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I don't know, tartarus isn't so bad.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I don't like it. i don't like it one bit.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I don't think so either.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I figured i'd save the really scary games For next year when fluttershy's more used to it.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I get different little, niggly feelings and they mean different things.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I get you.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I got this!
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I gotta get back to my shift at sugarcube corner anyway.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I guarantee that this is going to be the funnest, most fantabulous, superbial party in ponyville?
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I had to wrap myself up in the tarp i was gonna use to gather flowers, And then i saw fluttershy and rarity.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I hate it when food burns your mouth Or overwhelms it with flavor.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I have a very detailed pie-ling system.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I have balls stashed all over ponyville. in case of ball emergency.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I have decided That the earth ponies are gonna go it alone!
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I have some free time next Tuesday.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I have to convince prince rutherford That asking for help is ok.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I haven't found squat in any of the books i've been looking through.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I hear rainbow dash's pet tortoise tank, Has been having tummy troubles.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I heard hoofsteps, a loud thud.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I heard somepony else in the dessert car, and chased them up to the engine.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I just do!
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I just really like to watch others enjoy my pies.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I just wish the yaks could see how friendly And wonderful and great equestria really is!
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I knew I was going to have to keep a close eye on you, and that's just what I'm gonna do.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I knew it was you.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I knew rarity and applejack wanted to get Out of their element.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I know it's short notice, But we had such a great time at his birthday party, I thought we could have even more fun At his after birthday party.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I know smiles, and those smiles?
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I know!
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I know, right? who'd have guessed That hard hat wouldn't build whatever you want?
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I made a pie for everypony And you're the only one who hasn't eaten hers yet.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I mean, can i help you move this along?
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I mean, have you ever seen rocks like this?
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I mean, i can see you're not doing anything With anypony else.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I need help.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I never did get that pony's name.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I planted mine earlier than first.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I should crack open mudbriar like a rock!
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I should throw a great, big, ginormous.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I should've been a big enough pony to admit that, and let you have your day.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I shut down the party.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I subtly hinted for an invitation in my letters to him.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I suppose being trapped for all time with a super duper bad guy In limbo might be ok if you were doing the limbo.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I swore i had one here somewhere.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I think i have one in my bag.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I think i just blew your mind.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I think rainbow dash is right!
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I think we can fix that.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I thought i was giving tours today.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I thought we were just teaching you How to have fun at the dance.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I thought you hired professional contractors.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I tried to go to yakyakistan so i could bring something back for my party.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I understand. your studies come first.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I wanted to make sure you had a chance to, Say hello to your ol' pal, spike.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I wanted to thank you for saving me from the pie pyramid, So have a pie!
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I was already in!
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I was born on a tuesday.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I was born ready!
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I was elected Because i know how to think outside the box, Which means.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I was here guarding the cake the rest of the night.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I was really unfair to you, And i'm ready to listen to your ideas for maud's birthday.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I won't let you down.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I wonder where cranky got this?
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I would also accept maud.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I would not describe that as beautiful blue or white But heh heh, ok!
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I'd have never have picked noodles as the official food Of whinnyapolis either But, here we are.

Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I've already checked discord's dimension, Granny smith's wax museum, and yakyakistan!
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I've always had fun playing with Little kids, and i thought Babysitting meant just more Playtime, right?
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I've been making rainbow dash pies for years, But she doesn't even like them!
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I've labeled you all ponies of interest.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_I've never seen you before.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_If only we had some kind of super sudsy mane conditioning Shampoo for you.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_If this really is like somnambula's story.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_If twilight and the others knew what was going on, They would be here to help in a pony's heartbeat.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Noisy_In fact, the only thing i might have gotten wrong Was that there were even more porter ponies.

Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_Shouldn't your princessness be heading to the royal box seats?
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_So even if you're missing out, it's never for long.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_So get ready, ponies, the running of the leaves will begin in five minutes!

Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_So it was you!
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_So then, i decided to throw a finish ringing the school bell party!
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_So why did this criminal devour the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness while leaving this trio of tasty treats untouched?
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_So you're wearing a wig?
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_So, basically, it works like this.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_Some are fast!
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_Somersault, kick!
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_Something is rotten in.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_Sometimes you just have to believe in things, even when you can't figure 'em out.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_Sorry!
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_Sorry, can't help it!
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_Sounds like a stretch.

Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_That makes sense.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_That she got from princess celestia?
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_That usually means i'm hungry. let's eat!
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_That usually means look out for opening doors.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_That way, their delicious dessert would reign supreme.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_That way, when the rest of the weather team comes here to break the ice, it'll be easy as pie.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_That's okay. ponyville has thirty seven medals, and cloudsdale thirty six.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_That's what i said.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_That's, one two three four.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_The balloons had never been inflated!
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_The cakes are burning! you left the ovens on!
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_The cloud over our table looked like an ice cream sundae!
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_The curtains mysteriously closed, all on their own.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_The other ponies in town have.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_The post pony was going to deliver it, But after a strawberry cinnamon cilantro cupcake.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_Then do more! this is a dream, remember?

Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_There you are!
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_There! now you look like a pirate. A sleepy pirate, with a really weird mane cut.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_These are the books that princess would sit up with all night.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_This burden falls on my rump, and my rump alone.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_This is griffonstone, right?
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_This is my pet alligator gummy.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_This is precious cargo you're carrying.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_This may look like fun.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_This was an ear flop, then eye flutter, then knee twitch.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_Three hours? but when did you sleep?
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral_Very Noisy_Thus, destroying the cake and the Cakes' chance of winning the National Dessert Competition.

Pinkie_Pie_Neutral__I've got to get very important ingredients for a very important Pony's cake, and it's gotta be tippy top super duper secret.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral__If Miss harshwhinny is there well, then, game over right?
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral__If only we had fluttershy to do her stare on the flutterbat.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral__If she were, then we wouldn't be best sister friends forever.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral__If we were at the end of equestria, we'd be sitting on a big a!
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral__If you say so.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral__If, you still want to plan it together.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral__In her defense, it is delicious.
Pinkie_Pie_Neutral__In my secret party planning cave.

Quibble Pants_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Uh, please, please don't. just don't even mention the titles.
Quibble Pants_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Which is why i came here to ask a k yearling, muzzle to muzzle.

Quibble Pants_Anxious_Noisy_And her dad was some big athlete too. i-i can't compete with that.
Quibble Pants_Anxious_Noisy_Could, could you talk to her?
Quibble Pants_Anxious_Noisy_Do i? i don't know! one thing's for sure, Wind is never going to like a pony like me.
Quibble Pants_Anxious_Noisy_I mean that's, that's just bad business! what, what are these ponies thinking?
Quibble Pants_Anxious_Noisy_I thought if i could convince wind I was a big buckball fan, we'd have something to bond over but i.
Quibble Pants_Anxious_Noisy_I-i'm sorry wait, is this supposed to be making me, feel better?
Quibble Pants_Anxious_Noisy_I-i-i guess, i could, hold it for you. you know so you don't have to carry it.

Quibble Pants_Anxious_Noisy_glad i found you because i have a confession to make. I, know it's hard to imagine but I'm,.
Quibble Pants_Anxious_Noisy_i'm not even a hundred percent sure what bucking is, i literally know nothing about buckball, or any other sport!
Quibble Pants_Anxious_Noisy_i, i need to get wind to like me now.
Quibble Pants_Anxious_Noisy_i-i mean, you're a famous sports pony y-you'd know what to say.
Quibble Pants_Anxious_Noisy_if i say no do i still have to run?
Quibble Pants_Anxious_Noisy_really? how does me making a fool of myself in front of her sky, And a, billion buckball fans make sense!?
Quibble Pants_Anxious_Noisy_this is hopeless i, i don't have any skills not agility not speed i, i can't even lift more than one book, a-and i love books!
Quibble Pants_Anxious_Noisy_wh a-and this? no idea!
Quibble Pants_Anxious_Noisy_which is why i need your help!

Quibble Pants_Anxious_Very Noisy_I'm all for making things feel as real as possible But are these adventu cation ponies, sure this thing is safe?
Quibble Pants_Anxious_Very Noisy_This is real?
Quibble Pants_Anxious__I don't know what any of this stuff is!
Quibble Pants_Anxious__The seven sided chest of chicomoztoc.
Quibble Pants_Confused Annoyed_Very Noisy_And we're out here because?
Quibble Pants_Confused Annoyed__Where are you going?
Quibble Pants_Confused__yes. what do you mean?
Quibble Pants_Fear_Very Noisy_This is real!
Quibble Pants_Happy_Noisy_That sounds awesome!
Quibble Pants_Happy_Noisy_Whew! ok! what a race! right?
Quibble Pants_Happy_Noisy_oh but first, i got you a little surprise.
Quibble Pants_Happy__I-I mean the way you saved me on the bridge? wow.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_Because it's not.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_But the rules don't say that.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_But wind and i just made a connection!
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_Do you think, a k yearling would consider Letting me write the next book?
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_Good catch. oh i'm quibble pants. nice to meet you.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_Hey there.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_I'm not saying those books don't exist i'm saying.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_I, i guess only a, real fan would understand that.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_I, i-i wanted to be first inside to experience The grand history of the sport.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_If that goal is ours, it's only two to one And we can keep playing.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_It says very clearly on page six forty seven Of the expanded buckball tournament rules.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_It's right here.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_Just a little too much crazy out here For the both of us.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_Listen pal, you can keep her money, but i'm not.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_Maybe, you could, talk me up a little.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_No problem! i-i-i probably would have done it anyway i mean i.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_Not even my presents are in the ball court.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_Now this is something that only a true fan can appreciate.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_Oh not just a book, it's a buckball almanac.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_Oh yeah. she's great. honestly, i've never been happier.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, sure! with all the bu-bucking and the balling.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_Oh. ok, well maybe this isn't the absolute worst idea ever.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_Oh. well i, i mean, sure. that, that makes sense We could just go to the tournament instead.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_Ok i'll give you that one, I mean we could have been done for.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_Ok, i've got it. let's create a fake treasure Out of mud and rocks.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_Ok. i'm gonna head back inside.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_Ok. uh huh.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_Rainbow dash, fancy meeting you here.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_Rainbow dash, i'd like you to meet, clear sky.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_See now that's a great character! Solid backstory. good motivations.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_So, what's the setup here? you've kidnapped us And taken us to the middle of nowhere because?
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_So. maybe the later books are slightly more realistic Than i gave them credit for.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_That a goal is scored when an earth pony sends the ball Into a basket, but it doesn't say which basket!
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_That in curse of the jungle queen, daring do could survive A sixty story drop.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_That is if wind's up for it.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_That somehow manages to be self reflexive and ironic.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_The first series was smart and cool And an amazing nod to old time serialized adventure books.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_There's nothing fancy or confusing about it.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_These two, both have earth ponies fighting serpents.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_These two, have unicorns fighting bears, but this one.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_This thing has every buckball fact And statistic ever recorded.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_Uh, i have a seventeen charisma. don't you think i tried?
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_Uh. not particularly original or inspired, but it worked.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_While at the same time, celebrating the art form Without a hint of cynicism.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_Wow. ok. yeah. i'm i'm sorry but i could never.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_You know, i-i'd like a chance to catch up With rainbow dash. why don't we split up? We'll cover more ground that way and.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_You said you wanted to rethink things.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_You too.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_and she is pretty amazing too!
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_because on page eighty four of sapphire stone.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_from team ponyville.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_from the northwest section Of the field, when the wind is blowing from the east.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_give that to caballeron and then when.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_i know! i-i never, realized there was so much math in buckball.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_i'll try to remember that if i ever decide to play buckball again, but, i probably won't.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_oh i've just been arranging for us to hang out with a few of my close friends.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_oh look, pinkie pie's going to flip and triple bounce the ball into the goal.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_oh! perfect timing.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_oh, so much for speed.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_ow.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_pinkie flips and triple bounce bucks Over eight three percent of her shots.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_still don't like them.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_the most amazing pony i've ever met.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_the real question is, what kind of sports fan doesn't?
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_they sure are.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_ugh, Finally! look. each door has another door that matches.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Noisy_w-which is where they play buckball.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Very Noisy_And buckball!
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Very Noisy_And that, is everything that's wrong with daring do, And the trek to the terrifying tower.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Very Noisy_I know what you mean.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Very Noisy_I think rainbow dash and i have this covered.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Very Noisy_It's so hard to find a pony who really gets it.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Very Noisy_Now, the problems with the next book are even.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Very Noisy_Speed.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Very Noisy_These two, have pegasi fighting griffons.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Very Noisy_Um. you're real.
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Very Noisy_Which would make daring do left hoofed, which we know is false!
Quibble Pants_Neutral_Very Noisy_Whoa, whoa, whoa. there are no, other books.
Quibble Pants_Neutral__And escaping from the temple! you, rainbow dash, are awesome.
Quibble Pants_Neutral__And she did way more of that in the original trilogy.
Quibble Pants_Neutral__And that's ok!
Quibble Pants_Neutral__But clearly, daring do is embellishing And the correct number of arrows is.
Quibble Pants_Neutral__But, then on page one hundred and seven, daring do says she.
Quibble Pants_Neutral__But, you, are definitely cool.
Quibble Pants_Neutral__Friends?
Quibble Pants_Neutral__Got it.
Quibble Pants_Neutral__I guess, we don't have to agree on everything to get along.
Quibble Pants_Neutral__I love the daring do that, solves puzzles and uses her brain To get out of tough situations.
Quibble Pants_Neutral__I mean, think i could make things way clearer i mean for instance.
Quibble Pants_Neutral__I'm I'm the biggest fan there is.
Quibble Pants_Neutral__It describes her dodging a quote, score of arrows shooting forth From holes in the very walls, unquote.
Quibble Pants_Neutral__Maybe we could watch some of the tournament together and, You could teach me some sports stuff?
Quibble Pants_Neutral__No offense.
Quibble Pants_Neutral__She doesn't even like daring do.
Quibble Pants_Neutral__This, isn't the official daring do experience Adventu cation, is it?
Quibble Pants_Neutral__We might never agree on what makes daring do cool.
Quibble Pants_Neutral__Y-you can't keep me away from that, that buckball rink.
Quibble Pants_Neutral__You, love the daring do that is brave and awesome And comes out on top no matter what the odds.
Quibble Pants_Neutral__because it's sort of, this thing that i've already written a lot of fan fiction on i don't want you, know not that i'm saying that you would steal it.
Quibble Pants_Neutral__but i am saying, that this would totally go along my whole thing about puzzle solving except.
Quibble Pants_Neutral__i can't wait to see the.
Quibble Pants_Neutral__i'm kind of a yearlite myself, so i'm sure she'd be open to.
Quibble Pants_Neutral__in the second adventure there's a side character i don't want to, kind of name it right now.
Quibble Pants_Neutral__oh.
Quibble Pants_Neutral__quote barely made it, past the trap's, barrage, of arrows unquote.
Quibble Pants_Neutral__really not all that sporty.
Quibble Pants_Neutral__sorry.
Quibble Pants_Neutral__think of it that way right?
Quibble Pants_Neutral__what if each puzzle that was solved unlocked a new karate move?
Quibble Pants_Sad Anxious_Noisy_But i guess it backfired, do you think we could start over?
Quibble Pants_Sad Anxious_Noisy_I really want things with clear sky to work out, But if wind doesn't like me, i-i might as well give up.
Quibble Pants_Sad Anxious_Noisy_Look, sky, i know you're thinking Of calling it quits between us mand after today.
Quibble Pants_Sad Anxious__i'm sorry i was trying so hard to convince you otherwise I just, really wanted us to get along but.
Quibble Pants_Sad_Noisy_And pretending i did, just made things worse.
Quibble Pants_Sad_Noisy_Apparently this book is as close to sports As i'll ever get.
Quibble Pants_Sad_Noisy_I don't blame you,.
Quibble Pants_Sad_Noisy_I was just, trying to get her to like me.
Quibble Pants_Sad_Noisy_They're a family. even if it's ok with clear sky, i wouldn't ask them to make me a part of it if wind sprint isn't on board.
Quibble Pants_Sad_Noisy_Ugh. thanks for trying, rainbow dash But, i think we can both agree the whole sportify idea was a big, flop.
Quibble Pants_Sad_Noisy_Wind and sky deserve a pony they both like In their lives.
Quibble Pants_Sad_Noisy_besides sky wants to rethink things so i'm, i'm just beating her to the lunch.

Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_May the best pony win.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Maybe if i just leave you in the jungle, it'll convince you.

Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_One of you must have done this!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Or at least for me.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Personally, i think we should come up with a backup plan.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Pinkie pie!

Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Rarity! you were supposed to be holding your bucket!

Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Rumble, where's your lazy brother?
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Scootaloo, you don't understand.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Scootaloo.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_See, this is what i was telling you about!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_See? these griffons are exactly like i'd thought they'd be.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Seriously, fluttershy! the turtle? what did you bring that thing here for?
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Seriously?
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Seriously?

Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Seriously? don't even get me started On those clothing descriptions in shadow spade!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Seriously? ugh.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_She kicked us out of the shop!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_She's scared of caves now, too.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Show yourself!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_So now it's your turn to watch the dragon migration with me!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_So somepony zap us back out!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_So we can't unite and use the elements of harmony against you, that's why!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_So what are you hiding?
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_So you are behind this!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_So you don't care about anypony but your friends?
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_So you should stop pretending.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_So, are we gonna train hard?
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_So, what are we waiting for?
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Somepony was up here!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Stop horsing around, fluttershy. we've got a lot of training to do.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Suck it up, fluttershy! this is no time for.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Surprise, surprise. You ran out again!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Sweat? seriously!?
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Thanks a lot, map.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_That coughing better be from a popcorn kernel, thunderlane.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_That he's willing to turn his back On the coolest hero of all time!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_That is the face i do not want to see.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_That's it, we're leaving!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_That's it, you're coming with me!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_That's it. party's over.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_That's ok, because i could never be friends with somepony who's.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_That's right!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_The princess asked you a question!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_The room wouldn't need brightening if they weren't making it so dark!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_There are absolutely no freak natural disasters Going on anywhere.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_There is no such thing as a small detail!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_There is nowhere to chillax in this castle.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_There's no need to go strutting around nd showing off like that.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_These crystal ponies lost a thousand years to an evil king's curse.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_They can't all be your favorite!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_They're wrong.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Think we got bigger problems than making sure our hair bows match our horseshoes.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_This is the sovereign territory of pegasopolis.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Tried that one.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Trust you!? you've spent more time changing clothes Than trying to help me!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Try us, dipcord!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Twilight's right. We got to get her to spill the beans.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Ugh! make up your minds!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Ugh, fine.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Ugh, we're going to wonderbolts' headquarters.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Ugh.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Ugh.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Ugh. fine.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Um maybe you should let daring do figure it out?
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Wait a minute, why are you here?
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_We are!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_We cannot let anything Distract us from the mission at hand.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_We don't have time to look at the decor!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_We were using that!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_We're twilight's best friends! this should be easy for us!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Well, that took forever.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Well? aren't you curious about how it went?
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_What are you doing? Don't go around the rock! go over it!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_What are you looking at!? pinkie pie and i are just having a conversation!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_What do you take us for?
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_What is with these ponies?
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_What's the problem?
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_What's your name?
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Whatever color you are, it's the color of trouble.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_When she came to ponyville She was a total jerk to all my friends, especially pinkie pie!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Where is an out of control vehicle when you need one?
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Who said that?
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Who you callin' a chump, chump?
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Whoa, what would you know!? you're a dragon!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Why can't she see how dangerous they are?
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Why can't twilight use her magic for a change?
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Why can't you make enough cider for all of us?
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Why didn't you come back to Ponyville.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Why do i always have to do all the high up chores?
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Why don't you cut the bat act and come on down?
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Why is this so hard?
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Yeah! and to top it off you're accusing us Of not being able to tell he was up to something!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Yeah, i said it.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Yeah, right. like i'm gonna thank her.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Yeah, well, i'm still.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Yeah, yeah.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Yearling looks forward to her retirement.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_You big liar!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_You can't be tied for the most daring pony!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_You lied to me about soarin's wing just so you could get a better flyer!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_You made me clip my wing.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_You may be a winning team, but you're still not the kind of team i want to be a part of.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_You may have them now, but we're going to get our cutiemarks back.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_You only mentioned it about fifteen times on the train here.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_You owe me!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_You think you're the top athlete in all of ponyville?
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_You're a team! and a team never leaves a friend behind!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_You're barely able to just get off the ground!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_You're the pony of shadows?
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_You're trying to land the equestria games here!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_You, on the other hand, better keep practicing.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_Your ticket?!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_a little less talking, and a little more helping!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_and She's gonna learn that the hard way.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_and we'd all be better off spending time working to make equestria a better place.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_and, Why do you care so much about griffons anyway?
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_because my students are gone.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_cares how good the cider Is if i never get to drink any?
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_easy to work with.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_here it is, for pony's sake!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_hey! i heard that!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_how am i supposed to lead a filly guides hike, if the map makes us more lost?
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_look, i am a hundred percent sure the crystalling isn't happening.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_my name's not crash.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_ok king sombra. time to give up the crown.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_popcorn and cotton candy? rip off!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_scootaloo, where have you been?
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_then we'll just have to beat him the old fashioned way!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_ugh. i-i can't read this thing.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_we need to be able to fly, duh.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_we're not playing that!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Noisy_well, of course i know that!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Very Noisy_A visitor who's important and slow.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Very Noisy_All you did was ask about cake, admire decor, And change outfits a gazillion times!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Very Noisy_And i am going to give you a job so simple and straightforward, Not even you can weasel your way out of it.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Very Noisy_And i'm kinda hoping you ponies will untie me Before we all take a bath in bubbling green slime!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Very Noisy_And it's not like anypony else has color coordinated horseshoes or anything!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Very Noisy_And then some. it's like twilight herself in book form.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Very Noisy_And unless you wanna end up in the dungeon, You'll tell her what she wants to know!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Anypony else starting to think this is a lost cause?
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Are you kidding?
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Aww, i was just there!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Best out of ten, best out of twenty, best out of a hundred!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Very Noisy_But don't say i didn't warn you! this isn't a game, you know!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Very Noisy_But i haven't named a winner.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Very Noisy_But there is a pony downstairs who thinks everything You've written after the first trilogy is totally unrealistic And terrible.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Can they clean up glitter? ew! it's on my hooves!

Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Very Noisy_I claim this rock for pegasopolis!

Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Very Noisy_It was your idea, applejack!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Very Noisy_It's headless, not brainless.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Just don't let anypony trade for any chicken while i'm gone, okay?

Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Tank!
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Very Noisy_That could take forever! There's got to be a way to narrow it down.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Very Noisy_That's 'cause we're playing too nice.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Very Noisy_That's not what being a wonderbolt is all about.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Very Noisy_The day i get a hooficure is the day i turn in my daredevil license.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Very Noisy_The leader of my activity, applejack.

Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Very Noisy_This year, i'm gonna get there Before sunrise, so i can drink All the cider i want and laugh When she doesn't get any.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Thunder lane is just cooking up an excuse to spend tornado day in bed.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Very Noisy_To hear what the actual wonderbolts think about you Joining just to drop out for the washouts.
Rainbow_Dash_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Twilight literally wrote a book on what we need to do in griffonstone.

Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Noisy_And being part of the reserves means you'll have the opportunity to live your dream as a wonderbolt!
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Noisy_And i just saw him and his henchponies come this way.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Noisy_And it'll grow powerful enough to escape into the real world!
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Noisy_And just being reckless.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Noisy_And not just pinkie's pies, all pies.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Noisy_And now you've invited a whole lot of crazy into my life!
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Noisy_And, and it kinda sounded like she didn't think i was cool either.

Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Noisy_Applejack, if you're scared, you can just admit it.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Noisy_Are you okay?

Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Noisy_But i've gotta learn this stuff. now!
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Noisy_But it's like, the harder i try to convince scoot They're dangerous, the more she likes them.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Noisy_But most ponies don't know that you actually are daring do.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Noisy_But the exchange ends at sundown!
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Noisy_But there's a reason i didn't tell them i'm a wonderbolt.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Noisy_But this isn't about me.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Noisy_But we have to convince her that ponies do appreciate her!
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Noisy_But we thought that the thing she was worrying about wasn't worth worrying about.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Noisy_But what could the washouts possibly have that i don't?
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Noisy_But what if she chooses them over me?
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Noisy_But why won't you let me team up with you, just this once?
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Noisy_But, i don't know how my teammates will feel about me practicing with the competition.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Noisy_But, you'll never become a wonderbolt If you're too afraid to shine.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Noisy_C'mon no! wait! come back! don't leave me!

Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Noisy_The jungle it took forever to get to! this is the real deal!
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Noisy_The new book is obviously delayed because she needs help dealing with whatever everyday Nonsense is distracting her from spending her every living breathing second writing.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Noisy_The students dropped out of the sky!
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Noisy_Then is somepony blackmailing you, and forcing you to retire?

Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Noisy_You zapped my weather pony!
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Noisy_You're letting her lull you into a false sense of confidence.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Noisy_You've got to admit that's weird.

Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_I can't do the sonic rainboom. and just look at these boring, plain old feathered wings.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_I don't know any of this history!
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_I don't know.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_I don't want to go home Empty hoofed after promising We'd find her.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_I don't want to miss the crystalling!
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_I faked my injury so i wouldn't have to choose Between flying for ponyville, or cloudsdale.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_I figure we just hide out here until the effects wear off.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_I guess you won this one, maud.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_I just thought, maybe possibly you might wanna go back to say.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_I just want to make sure you don't get hurt.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_I know you weren't expecting to see your brother But, you've been kinda quiet. even for you.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_I know! there might be no more books!
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_I mean, it may have something to do with these joke cookies.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_I mean, they even broke the trophy.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_I mean, we're good and all but.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_I need to trade this horseshoe for, that.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_I still can't believe we all just blabbed everything that happened to that reporter.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_I still can't believe we had to give back the elements.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_I think I'm gonna be sick.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_I think it's something in the cookies.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_I thought you guys might like to say goodbye to tank.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_I wanted to fly with you both, and the decision was too hard!
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_I'll be right there.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_I'll explain later! come on!

Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_I'm slipping!
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_I'm sorry i got all swept up by cheese sandwich.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_I'm sorry we couldn't get a breeze going that would get them back to the others.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_I'm sorry, but we gotta help spike!
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_I'm telling you, we'll never pass for a real dragon!
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_I've only got till noon to make the fastest cart ever.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_If the dam breaks, the whole town will be flooded!
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_If they both place, cloudsale wins the medal count!
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_Is, everything okay?
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_It doesn't look like both of us can make it at this speed!
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_It doesn't matter, We'll never solve the griffon's lock before they get back.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_It sounded like fluttershy to me.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_It was way more terrifying than the most terrifying thing I could have thought of!
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_It's sort of panic themed.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_Just to see if we can handle the kind of massive pressure That comes with hosting the equestria games!
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_Just, keep guessing fabrics.
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_Missus cake! whew, have you seen pinkie?

Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_The griffon's lock!
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_The idol!
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_The rush? don't you remember what happened Last year? Or the year before that? Or pretty much any cider season ever?
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_The way out is totally covered!
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_Then you just gotta stop feeling bad for what you did!
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_Throw me another rope!
Rainbow_Dash_Anxious_Very Noisy_Turns out the crystal castle doesn't have a gymnasium.

Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_'cause every pony who's ever come in.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_'cause, i've been trying to get into that group For like, ever.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_A friend who stuck by us no matter what.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_A hero!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_A long time ago, before the wonderbolts were even founded.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_A series of athletic contests To decide who's the best, once and for all.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_A, wonderbolt.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_Actually, i haven't seen her all week.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_Actually, i learned it at scootaloo's filly guides camp.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_Actually, what i meant is after i'm done whipping up today's weather, I'll be chilling by the lake catching some rays.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_After a lifetime of awesome, i think everypony's Allowed to mess up every now and then, right?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_Agh! on second thought, maybe you better stay here and rest.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_Ah, come on. i knew it all along.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_Ah, it was nothing.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_Ahuizotl?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_All i have to do is go up there and explain to everypony How wrong they all are.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_All part of our plan, right applejack?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_All right, then.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_All right, who's ready to sell some cookies?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_Almost.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_Alright team, you're cleared for takeoff!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_Alright, now these games will determine which one of you has the most important qualities i'm looking for in a pet.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_Alright, ponies, listen up!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_An experienced flyer like me knows how to multitask.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_And also, no!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_And because getting rid of all those pies was a giant hassle.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_And don't forget, we've got to catch the early train for the crystal empire.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_And here you all are doing it.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_And i believe a pony oughta appreciate hard work paying off like this.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_And i guess i should also act with grace and humility When, others outshine me.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_And i just happened to hear that you have an extra ticket?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_And i need to learn the routine.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_And i probably shouldn't because eavesdropping is wrong But, still.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_And i'm just sorry we didn't get your idol back.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_And i'm thinking big mac sold a huge order of apples to filthy rich.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_And if it wasn't for her, the region would be cursed With eternal night.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_And it just doesn't matter if you can fly or not.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_And it's probably best keeping all the grownups On the sidelines.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_And it's up to the three of us to make sure that we qualify at the trials.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_And no pony will ever call me rainbow crash after this.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_And ok, she destroyed your statue, But it was because she was trying to save you all From ahuizotl!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_And she was only in a rush because she had to get the crown Back to the tiara of teotlale, before the curse took effect.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_And that!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_And that's a lot worse than losing some crummy old statue!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_And the only racer who crossed the finish line with me, was the one who stopped to save me when i needed help.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_And the pegasus is on defense.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_And there may or may not be some daring do posters up in your library.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_And we all saw how well that turned out.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_And we could never have a party without you.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_And we probably could have done a better job Of listening to you.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_And we're walking, and we're walking.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_And we're your friends.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_And what a heap of rotten apple cores these articles are!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_And who is this?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_And you're gonna build it!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_And, if something bad happens that you didn't intend, You shouldn't give up hope or lose faith in yourself.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_And, you know, not try to make us recreate Everything that happened when you weren't around.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_Another pegasus just got back from baltimare with an all clear and.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_Any questions?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_Anyway, spike here Writes down everything i say.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_Applejack and i just need a little workout.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_Applejack?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_Are you kidding?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_Are you sure you want Fluttershy to come along?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_Are you sure?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_As a fellow aerobatic professional, I really enjoyed your show.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_As daring do trekked through The tropical jungle, the wet Heat sapped her energy and Slowed her every step.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_Aw, come on! i even said shopping that time.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_Aw, shucks! You, rained on my cumulus!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_Aww cheer up, fluttershy.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_Azurantium? you know, the same metal That the amulet of atonement From daring do book four is made from?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_Because i know this opening ceremony is the single most important thing, That will ever happen in your young lives!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_Because it's not just where i live, but it's where my friends are.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_Because she asked me to.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_Because there were twenty ponies in the original Eup guard that became the wonderbolts.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_Because they've both fought to protect this town!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_Besides, ponyville will still qualify.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_Boo.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_Building snow ponies, starting snowball fights, Sipping hot cider by the fire.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_Bulk biceps, you're the first flyer, so let me see you flap it!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_Bummer spike had to miss out on all this.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_But i know who's got the goods to get into those woods.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_But i said whoever crosses the finish line with me gets to be my pet.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_But i'd need two perfectly placed trees, Some stretchy rope, and a pith helmet.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_But if you don't have to hibernate, why should tank?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_But it's gonna take more than muscles and yeahs to get us to the equestria games!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_But it's true.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_But pah! we all know that's crazy.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_But technically we weren't the last ponies to save equestria.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_But that custard was everything.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_But that was me.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_But that wouldn't hurt either.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_But then you pace, and you chart, you worry.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_But they finished the race.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_But was also scanning the sky and the ground for any problems.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_But when you get bored with twilight's tour book, I'll be at the abysmal abyss finding the idol of boreas.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_But whichever of you make it across the finish line with me, will have proven you can keep up with me.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_But you can out think them.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_But you love yelling and blowing your whistle.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_But you still flew rings around me.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_But you'll have to in the solo trials.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_But you're going about it in the wrong way.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_But you're ponyville's permanent party pony.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_But you're right. this is really important. i've gotta get that book!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_But, i'm afraid this is the radicalness competition, so i'm gonna have to take some points off.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_But, i'm pretty beat.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_But, if you're going to join us and do something that really Makes a difference.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_But, not too scary.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_But, teamwork means listening to other ponies so, it's up to you.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_But, that's when i'll be at the swimming hole.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_But, that's why she's in charge of choosing who gets the games, And we're not.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_But, we can't take on braeburn and his team Without any practice.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_But, what about the cauldron?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_But, you know if, if that isn't important to you.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_By the end of the day, i'm going to turn you into The sportiest pony, in equestria!

Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_I just thought of a great way to raise awareness For your original fan club.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_I knew it would be dark and dangerous.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_I know applejack has a lot of relatives But i feel like she would've mentioned you.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_I know i was supposed to let you make your own decisions but.

Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_I should have known you were the brains behind A crazy idea like the washouts.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_I shouldn't have said that, or made fun of the other stuff You like to do.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_I think it's a bufogren! they have really sensitive ears.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_I think the dragon was expecting a little something for his efforts.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_I think they broke my record for most stuff broken in under a minute.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_I think they have a pretty good idea.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_I think we should cancel the washouts fan club, Because i know a fan club that could use some new members.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_I think, you should leave.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_I thought you'd never ask!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_I was asleep at midnight.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_I was hoping you could tell me about a pony named daring do. I hear she's an awesome adventure pony hero.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_I was sure he'd give up after like three rocks.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Noisy_I wish I had someone to do whatever i told them.

Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_He can take care of himself.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_He's ready to hibernate.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Head on home, put your feet up, i'm sure eventually you'll have the strength to make yourself soup or something.

Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Hold on, rarity! i'm coming!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Huh. not what i expected.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Huh? oh, the map!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Hyah! loop the loop around and whap!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I actually have something totally important to tell you!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I always liked flying and all, But I was going nowhere in a hurry.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I can see the finish line from here!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I did it.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I don't know about you, but i slept like a filly.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I got this.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I got you!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I gotta hear and see everything down to the littlest detail.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I guess some ponies thrive on pressure, And some ponies don't.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I hate to do this to those weather ponies, But desperate times call for desperate measures!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I hear water!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I just saw the smartest, Most generous pony about to get rained on.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I just want to know.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I know, right?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I know.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I know.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I mean, ahem, it was pretty cool.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I mean, how lame is that?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I mean, pinkie pie's parties are fun and sweet and all, But now this party's gonna be.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I prefer to think of them as everypony's trophie.,.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I remember when she said that to me.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I say we turn tail and bail while we still.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I shouldn't knock something until I've tried it.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I think she gave him a boost.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I think we can get a top speed over a thousand!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I thought you maybe went to applejack's instead.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I was born to make thunder!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I was never hurt in the first place.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I was thinking, i might have something to do With her not feeling great.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I wish we were having as much fun as they are.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I would draw their attention With my super speed strut.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'd never flown like that before.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'll come help you!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'll fly by last and when i signal you.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'll just do a quick fly over And we'll have the elements in no time.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'll just ignore that.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm gonna fly up there and check it out!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm gonna have to shave a point off your score for that.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm good.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm here for princess celestia's royal garden opening tomorrow.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm hitting the sack.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm in!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm staying here in Cloudsdale where everything's awesome.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm sure you'll find somepony else to take you.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm, on it!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I've always kinda wondered what it would be like to be a griffon!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I've been told.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_I've got you now, element.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_If each of you can get your numbers up to at least ten point o wing power By the end of the week.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_If only there was a way to lift fluttershy out of the dumps.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_If you want to stand guard, go for it.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_If you weren't here, well, I don't know who i'd be talking to right now.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_If, each and every pony trains, and trains hard To get their wing power numbers up.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_In a forest, just, like, this.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_In order to stay safe in the sky.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Into a super dangerous sundog spiral, when suddenly.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Is it supposed to sound like that?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Is the pay good?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Is there a bug in here?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_It can't be!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_It doesn't have to shoot fire!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_It doesn't matter.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_It gallops only at night.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_It made me think that pre flight checklists Could really help increase our efficiency.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_It still counts as a win if i push my cart across, right?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_It's a disaster!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_It's a good thing fluttershy isn't here Because she would never be able to handle this!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_It's more fun when you're with someone Who really knows daring do.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_It's only the biggest sporting event in all of equestria.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_It's that good, huh? well, maybe just one little hoof.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_It's working!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Just do the routine as it was!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Just give it a little kick pinkie.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Just gotta find that golden idol and get out of this place.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Just last week you went into that wicked nose dive To save that falling baby bird right before it hit the ground!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Just like this one.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Just like you asked.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Just like, ninety per.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Just make sure it's a horrible one.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Just wondering if the breezies are ready to go yet.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Karate, go!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Keep the fair going, and the crystal ponies' spirits high. done and done!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Keep your eye on number seven from cloudsdale, he's the favorite.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Kite flying, go!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Knock yourself out.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Lame.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Let's grab some grub!

Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Like we do.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Listen up, gang.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Look, just tell ak yearling that rainbow dash is here.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Looking for little lost ponies.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Looks like a bunch of dried sticks painted white to me.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Looks like my sky swim will have to wait.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Maybe for you. i practically fell asleep When i went through this.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Maybe not quite that hard.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Maybe there's no tree of harmony.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Maybe whatever twilight saw when she took that crazy potion, wasn't real.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Maybe, but who really knows?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Me? no no no, Of course not.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Most people thought That the sonic rainboom was just an old mare's tale.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Moving out!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_My teeth hurt.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Neither do i. let's go!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Never fear your friendly neighborhood rainbow.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Never know where enemies might be lurking.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_No offense, but it's not a real campfire story Unless somepony's shaking.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_No offense, pinkie.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_No offense.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_No offense.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_No, it's broccoli.

Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Nope.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Nope.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Nopony knows you like i do tank.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Not if we always stay one step ahead and don't fall for any of her mind games.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Not only that, but spitfire, captain of the wonderbolts, Will be here to oversee the water transfer and record our top tornado windspeed.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Not what i had in mind.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Not without you.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Now last year, fillydelphia broke the windspeed record With a top speed of nine hundred and ten wing power.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Now listen up!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Now, careful. you don't want to do any more Damage than you've already done.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Now, the wonderbolts are going to fly over this ridge Right before the finale of the show.

Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, you're being serious.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Ok, clearly this isn't the best time, but.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Ok, i don't get fabric, but i do get speed.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Ok, you know how i've been pranking everypony?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Okay girls, you heard her!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Okay, everybody get comfortable.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Okay, i guess i'll let you off the hook this time.

Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Okay.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_One more lap to go!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Only to be forced to contend with its dreaded and impenetrable arrow defense?

Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Pretty speedy, could be more speedy.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Quiet.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Rainbows aren't really known for their flavor.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Rarity for you is only hiring the best of the best, And to me, that means the fastest.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Ready?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Really?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Riding that entire season from cloudsdale to ponyville, was awesome.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Right this way, everypony.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Right. no problem.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Sabotage snowflakes? I think we gotta go bigger than that.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_See you later, birthday alligator!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_See you tomorrow, rarity!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Sell hats.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Seriously though.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Seriously! this is the most relaxed i've been all day.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Seriously, i'd do it for anypony.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_She must be in there.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_She tries to keep the ball from going in the goal And passes it back to the earth pony on her team.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Shouldn't take long.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Shouldn't you be critter proofing the library or something? Tank has a tendency to.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Sky obviously has no idea he's not actually amazingly awesome.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Slow and steady wins the race.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_So fluttershy, you want us to get the breeze going again so these little guys can get a move on?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_So i thought i'd kick a hole in the clouds To keep her dry so she could dine in peace, that's all.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_So less learning, and more chillaxing.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_So let's hop to it.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_So uh.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_So what's the big deal?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_So what? probably just a coincidence.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_So, here's the scoop.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_So, how deep is this abyss?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_So, how's about getting that address?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_So, maybe you can learn something.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_So, now that you know the elements of a good cheer, let's hear one!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Some of these popcorn kernels didn't get popped.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Somepony give blossomforth a hoof. Let's see some faster trotting, thunderlane!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Somepony put that picture in there as a joke.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Something tells me this isn't a circus act.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Sorry i messed up your dress thingie.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Sorry twi, been too busy prepping for my sonic rainboom To pay much attention to the bride's bad attitude.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Sorry, but i wasn't leaving you behind in that swamp.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Sorry. this is going back into hiding Where it belongs.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Sorta agile.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Sorta speedy, not speedy.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Speed.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Spreading my wings, the flag flapping in the breeze.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Stretch out those legs.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Style!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Style.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Sure thing, starlight glimmer.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Sure, long as you don't snore.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Thanks for doing this.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Thanks for keeping me company rarity.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Thanks, twilight.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_That little guy can never get to sleep without a bedtime story.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_That right there.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_That these very woods are haunted.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_That's right, zeph. you're coming with me.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_That's right.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_That's the first nice thing i've heard you say about yourself.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_That's weird. we've only done stuff from the first trilogy.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_The blueprint for my derby cart of course.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_The cloudsdales are wonderbolts, and wonderbolts are the best flyers there are.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_The crystal mountains? vanhoover? here?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_The doors aren't even open yet!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_The exchange is almost over.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_The fate of equestria is in our hooves.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_The key to this one is speed!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_The mosquitoes buzzed loudly. The macaws cried from the high trees.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_The race is about to start, scootaloo.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_The smell of decay and Danger hit daring do as she peered into the dimly lit Entrance of the ancient temple.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_The wonderbolts did a flyby.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Their eyes riveted on the wonderbolts.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Their technique could use some work, though.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Then i guess we'll just have to bust our way out!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Then there's no time to lose!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Then, i would mesmerize them With my fantastic filly flash!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_There are no winners.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_There's a ton of room for dangerous adventure along that route.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_These things are heavy! chock full of snowflakes!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_They freeze whatever part of the target they hit.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_They're so.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Those aren't your average arrows.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Today i learned what the most important quality really is. a certain kind of spirit.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Totally gonna be worth it when we get to winsome falls.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Tough break to lose a teammate for the tryouts.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Trust me.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Trust me. you are a totally different pony now.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Ugh, maybe the map should've called rarity instead of us.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Ugh. no sign of trouble here. Darn it.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Uh, i'm gonna hang here and read to him a bit.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Uh, speaking of.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Uh, you should probably stretch.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Uh, you think you could tighten the strap on my helmet?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Up all night, huh? is that why she's so, uh, out of it?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Watch that. it's all part of the game.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Watch, and learn!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Way you jumped that cart the other day?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_We can still fly completely in sync and blow spitfire's mind with our moves.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_We found all six keys, defeated tirek, and got this sweet castle!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_We just had lunch with fluttershy's parents And you'll never guess who showed up.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_We just have to trust fluttershy, She must know that she's doing.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_We kinda went around town and talked up the team a little.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_We need to be one of the first four teams to cross the finish line.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_We respect your decision to move to yakyakistan.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_We traded a crystal chalice for an antique chicken.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_We'd better move on before Rarity ruins winter and causes a drought.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_We're almost there, so i've got a few things to say.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_We're going to bed.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_We're gonna find that treasure, make griffonstone cool again, And get back to ponyville!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_We've got a race to get ready for!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_We've gotta get across the finish line to win a prize, So we might as well get there first right?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, duh.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, i think we should leave asap.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, let's find out.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, not something exactly.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Were all physical competitive abilities.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_What about a dragon? no?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_What are you two doing?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_What do you mean, raspy?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_What do you mean?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_What do you mean? didn't you help plan this?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_What kind of surprises?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_What's that noise?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_What? that's crazy talk.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_When everycreature starts listening to me.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_When scootaloo and her friends sell them.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Where you headed in such a hurry?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Who can be the first one to tell me what fabric this is?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Who cares about a few fish?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Who? oh, it's you, owlowiscious.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Whoa whoa whoa!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Whoa.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Whoever encases their entire target in ice first wins.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Whoo hoo! I win by a landslide.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Will do!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Will she at long last stalk the fortress of talikon?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_With the possible exception of bulk biceps, fluttershy and me.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Would you trade a lamp for my horseshoe so i can trade it for an orthros and get my book?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Yeah! if it gets strong because you feel bad About what you did as nightmare moon.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Yeah! we're already on it!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Yeah! why weren't you scared?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Yeah, 'cause all you said earlier was.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Yeah, i might be up for something like that.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Yeah, they're still mad.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Yes, starlight glimmer.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Yes, starlight glimmer.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Yet, all of these distracting Noises were not enough to cover The sound, of the predators Following her every step.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_You better shake a leg if you want a ride in the winning cart.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_You both gave up what you wanted to do something for each other.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_You did.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_You didn't let me finish!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_You don't snore, do you?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_You got it!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_You heard the pony! on your hooves!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_You know, i might even buy some Cider and hold on to it.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_You like scary stories, right?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_You need to chill.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_You only wanna get hit in the head by a flying turtle, once.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_You shouldn't miss a wingbeat, or drop a hair in altitude.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_You sure?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_You think that's weird? She raced me like, a hundred times the other day.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_You were jabbering on so much you didn't even notice.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_You were the one doing the angling.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_You worked really hard To make our dresses exactly the way we wanted them.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_You zip up the ramp on your scooter, And kick the storm cloud into my path.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_You're kidding.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_You're like me.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_Yup, i remember that feeling.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_and And someone needs to make sure that he doesn't slack off while i'm gone.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_and i need you to help me prove to him That it's all totally possible.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_aye, aye!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_built by admiral fairweather himself!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_bulky.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_but he knew he couldn't do this forever.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_but if i ever got to choose between winning, and being loyal to my friends.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_but the dragons wouldn't let them.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_but there's no room for mistakes!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_come on quibble, you got this!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_don't worry yona! that was the hard one.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_er, That's because you're carrying the flag for ponyville in the opening ceremony.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_faster than the dragons!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_fearless.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_flash magnus flew like the wind.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_he managed to get away but the dragons captured his friends, and took them back to their lair.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_i don't think that thing knows what small is.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_i gotta take care of a few weather jobs around here.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_i guess some ponies do.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_i'm just mad at somepony who was complaining about how awful hearth's warming eve is.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_it's all in good fun.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_it's the day we remember how unicorns, pegasi, and earth ponies came together in friendship to defeat the windigos!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_let's do this.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_mine's way easier.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_mornin', pink! gilda, this is my gal pal, pinkie pie.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_name it.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_not yet.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_ok, here's what we do.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_one taste of the lightning, and the dragons retreated!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_pinkie pie, you are so, random.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_ready.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_she's half eagle, half lion.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_some of it.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_tell ya what. I'll leave the teaching stuff to you And i'll just make sure they stay awake.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_time to take out the adorable trash.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_uh, Now what?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_we call in the weather patrol!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_we'll just go around them.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_we're just saying that it might not be the best idea to stay outside.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_while flash magnus bravely flew for his life, commander ironhoof was able to get his soldiers back.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_wow.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral_Very Noisy_yeah, i uh, i think i tweaked something at wonderbolts practice the other day.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__A good and heroic citizen deserves a little recognition.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__A likely story.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__A lot.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__A reservist one, yeah.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Agility.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Ah, never mind.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Aha!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Ahem.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Ahem.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Ahh.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__All right, you got me. what is it?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__All we need is a unicorn.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Alright, i'll do it.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Alright, scootaloo, remember the parts Where teamwork really comes into play!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__And I'm gonna meet the Wonderbolts so we can go over the routine one last time.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__And fluttershy is gonna be on applejack's team.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__And i always have fun when we're all together.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__And i thought you were the coolest wonderbolt ever.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__And it's barely a sports reference.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__And it's not like things can get any worse.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__And look at that!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__And my personal heroes.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__And rarity's weird fashion seasons.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__And show me your flag carrying skills.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__And sky needs to be able to fly without you, or he won't make it.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__And some kinda cool energy.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__And then i have to take tank to the vet.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__And we're totally cool with it.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__And we're your friends.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__And you know this from?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__And, no.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__And.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Another pie?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Any questions?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Applejack was gonna help me stack some hay So i could practice smashing through it.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Are we talking fun fun?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Are you kidding? one hundred percent!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Are you ready?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Aren't you all exhausted from your big day?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__As you can see, it's a delicate operation.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__At the celebration of the first celestial year of peace.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Aw shucks, it was nothing.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Awesome! who? who? do i know them?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Aww, that's okay. Don't worry about it.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Because, what makes you happy, makes me happy.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Being a Wonderbolt isn't just about showing off.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Besides, you saved us from those pony eating fish.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Boo.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Bring it!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Bring them up here would ya?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Buckball time is over!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Bummer spike got to miss out on all this.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Buses and baby carriages are always careening down this hill.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__But I still can't go.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__But it's nothing to get too excited about.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__But maybe i'm not the pony you should have come to for help.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__But she'll be here for sure. Applejack is never late.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__But since you and i know a k yearling personally.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__But that custard was everything.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__But we wanted to give you the chance to tell the truth.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__But when you didn't show, i had to do it all by myself!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__But you're pretty awesome yourself.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__But, applejack should definitely be teacher of the month.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__But, i bet if she were here.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__But, i know you're up for the challenge.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Bye Applejack! Go get 'em!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__C'mon!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Can you cover my classes?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Can't have a crystal fair without the crystal heart right.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Charm.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Chillax, applejack!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Cloudsdale flight school will probably be churning out Wonderbolts with him there.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Come on!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Come on, twilight!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Cool.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Coolness!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Could be more awesome.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Cutie mark?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Daring do and the griffin's Goblet.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Daring do was trying to save everypony from the Curse of the doomed diadem of xilati.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Definitely.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Delicious!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Don't mess with success, right?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Don't want to overprepare myself, you know?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Don't worry twilight!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Don't worry, i've got your flank.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Eat only soft foods.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Enjoy.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Ernie's undercooked pancakes.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Even if it's learning, pretending to be fun.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Everypony ok in there.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Everything turned out all right, right?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Except after luna was banished to the moon, Celestia needed protective forces.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Faster!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Few days. It might as well be a few months, Or a few years.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Finally!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__First time i heard those stories?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Fluttershy's a great support, but her cheering isn't exactly inspirational.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__For second place.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__From now on, i'm not letting you grannies out of my sight!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Go get your cutie marks back.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Go to our room and put on eyemasks and earplugs?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Good.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Got it!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Got it.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Granny smith's right! let's not overdo it.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Great pies!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Guess it was nothing, Heh heh.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Have you guys noticed how quiet it's gotten?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__He wanted to partner with daring do on her adventures.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__He wasn't even trying.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__He would have had fun here.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Heads up!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Heh heh. standing room only!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Hello ponies. we need rarity and applejack.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Here comes our answer.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Hey hey! we're all friends here!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Hey there, pinkie pie.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Hey, uh, you wouldn't mind telling the wonderbolts that, would ya?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Hey, we've got some time before the competition. Why don't Fluttershy and I show you around Cloudsdale?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Hi pinkie pie.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Hiya there, mister!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Hm. why don't i just let you finish signing in.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Honestly, they were all pretty slow.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__How 'bout this, your hugs are too tight.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__How about a nice nap so you can really enjoy las pegasus.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__How about some nice, soft carrot soup instead.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__How can i help?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__How could they be?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Huh.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Huh?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I agreed with you for the whole nature walk.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I can see it now.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I can't believe it.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I cannot believe you're giving up so easily!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I didn't know how rude she was.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I don't know how, but somehow, we're gonna get that orthros.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I got nothing so far.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I guess i did. i'm sorry everypony.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I guess you'll find out!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I have an idea, but i'm going to need your help.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I haven't really been thinking about how other ponies feel.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I just have to train for this show.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I just wish i could have met the wonderbolts when they were awake.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I know it does.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I know now who i should have been loyal to.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I know your thing is honesty, but come on!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I know.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I mean, how could you not appreciate that?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I mean, i got over it, because i realized pretty quick That if there was such thing as a headless horse, I could totally take it on.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I mean, i know hanging out with me is awesome But, it was like she'd rather keep losing than.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I mean, yeah!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I mean, yeah. i'm sure it was.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I mean, you were pretty awful.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I promise. i spent my whole life trying to be A standout flier but, now that i'm a wonderbolt.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I think i should be lead pony, ma'am.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I was hoping you'd say that. come with me.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I was scared too.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I was thinking right.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I was thinking.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I wouldn't say scared.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I'd never leave ponyville hanging.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I'll be there.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I'll check the back door.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I'll do it in a jiffy.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I'll just have to stop winter!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I'll pass the ball to you And you just pass it back to me.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I'll probably be working crowd control or something.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I'll take that as a yes.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I'll tell you the real problem here!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I'll tell you what we're meant to do.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I'm an egg head.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I'm gonna get her!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I'm gonna go rest up.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I'm gonna need every pegasus to break the record, including you.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I'm here to find your missing idol and save griffonstone!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I'm not nervous at all.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I'm right there with you, Sister.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I'm sorry i misjudged you for being older ponies.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I'm the one who should be apologizing.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I've got an idea.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__I-i don't know, spike.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Ice irises are almost impossible to find in spring!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__If we're facing impossible odds, we're facing them together!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__If we're gonna get Applejack to talk, we'll have to call in the big guns.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__If you say so!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__If you want to beat me, you better.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__In a, brainy egghead puzzle solving kind of way.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__In three two one, and.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Is that cinnamon?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__It all happened during the race at flight camp.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__It hit me when i was watching sky train with you.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__It needs to be about twenty percent cooler.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__It was a long time ago.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__It wasn't that bad.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__It's also a responsibility.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__It's not about making anypony feel bad.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__It's that one where, uh.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__It's, beating her to the punch.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Just as soon as i'm done practicing.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Just came to me.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Just checking.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Just looks like another old castle to me.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Just my pride.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Leave the hiring to me.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Lemme get that for ya.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Let me do something about that.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Lightning dust decided to use a tornado.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Long story.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Look, i'll be with you the whole night.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Look.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Looks like somepony's got a dark cloud hanging over her head.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Louder.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Magic's got nothing to do with it.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Make sure they get their naps.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Maybe i'd stand out more if i didn't.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Maybe they can help us.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Maybe we could find him a job, carrying heavy stuff?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Me neither.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Meet me after school tomorrow at fifteen hundred hours.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Mine's just not as cool as i was imagining.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__My fault, my fault, sorry i.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Nah. this mess is my responsibility And i've gotta clean it up myself.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Napping.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__New plan.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Next!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__No matter what, we face it together!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__No more arguing.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__No offense twilight, but, teaching at that school Was the most boring horrible awful thing ever.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__No problem.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__No problem.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__No way out!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__No wonder she's been gone so long.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__No, it's my fault.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__No. i just want my dress to be, cool.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__No. i was busy.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Nope!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Nope.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Nope. you're too easy. you're scared of everything.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Not cool.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Not many Pegasi wanted to help me clear the clouds.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Not much point of a pony pet playdate for me if i'm a pony without a pet, right?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Not really.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Now, uh, before we begin.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Now, what have we learned?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Of course! And I know we can pull it off!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Oh well. doesn't matter.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Oh yeah.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Oh, hey, twilight. what's up?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Oh, i'm not mad. you all are right.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Oh, sorry, guess it was nothing.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Oh, who's that, who's that?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Oh, yeah! i am so there. i've just got one question.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Oh, yeah, pipsqueak?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Ok, maybe like seventy percent.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Ok.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Okay, here's what we do.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Okay, let's hear it.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Okay.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Only pegasus ponies can walk on clouds.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Only twilight could make a dance remix about sweeping.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Or learning pretending to be fun?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Or maybe medium.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Pause for dramatic effect.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Piece o' cake.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Pinkie's mouth.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Pinkie.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Plus they knew a lot more about fabric than i did.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Ponies will open their boxes and start eating.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Pretty much all i can do is look at something, And tell you if it's clothes or not.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Previously under appreciated pony in ponyville.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Professionally.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Rarity, you look ridiculous.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Ready one, two, three!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Really?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Really? that is so not cool.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Reservists aren't in the show Unless one of the real wonderbolts can't fly.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Right apple rose?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Right applejack?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Right, applejack?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Right, team?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Right.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Right. heh!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Same difference.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Say no more!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Scootaloo?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__See, i was trying to get back into the hospital to finish the Last chapter of.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__See? everypony likes a good prank. they're just jokes.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Sending off one of my flight crews to retrieve the birds that have flown south for the winter.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Set go!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Sharp.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__She asked.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__She kind of is.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Sky, vapor was never trying to steal your spotlight.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__So earth unicorn and pegasi formed the eup guard Of the protective pony platoons.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__So what's stopping you?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__So would the mustache.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__So you can totally keep an eye on me.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__So, does this mean we're still friends?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__So, i hired them all!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__So, now what?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__So, what are you willing to trade for?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__So, what do i have to do To get to be one of the princess's royal guards anyway?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__So, what does everypony want to do tonight?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__So, where's zeph gonna go now?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__So, who's it gonna be?
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Solving tough problems is what you do!
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Sorry Twilight. I don't have time to talk.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Sorry about that, ladies.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Sorry, but I just heard from Spitfire that a whole bunch of storm clouds got loose from the cloud factory.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Sorry.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Sorry.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Sorry. new trick.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Sounds kind of intense.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Spitfire told me the wonderbolts need me To go on tour with them.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Sure, why not.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__Sure.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__That doesn't make any sense.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__That sounds a little too exciting.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__That sun will never rise again.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__That was good times.

Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__We practically invented sitting on bleachers.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__We split the empire up into five sectors.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__We're busting our chops as fast as we can.

Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__and she needs every Wonderbolt to help bust 'em.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__and you're completely clueless about anything having to do with athletics.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__because being a wonderbolt Is somethin' special.
Rainbow_Dash_Neutral__but her Crash landing in the jungle had Injured her wing, and she was Grounded for a few days.

Rainbow_Dash_Sad Anxious_Noisy_Night time, forever?
Rainbow_Dash_Sad Anxious_Noisy_See this picture? it looks like i won something awesome.
Rainbow_Dash_Sad Anxious_Noisy_She won't listen to me, she won't let me apologize.

Rainbow_Dash_Sad Anxious__I mean, it's why i came to las pegasus in the first place!
Rainbow_Dash_Sad Anxious__Or you might overdo it and we'd have to go home early.
Rainbow_Dash_Sad Anxious__She loves ponyville!
Rainbow_Dash_Sad Anxious__That is, if you're willing to help me after i acted like that.
Rainbow_Dash_Sad Anxious__The truth is, all i've wanted to do for this whole trip is ride the wild blue yonder!

Rainbow_Dash_Sad__But i can't go to las pegasus because i have to teach at twilight's school.
Rainbow_Dash_Sad__But just because I won't say it, doesn't mean I don't feel it.
Rainbow_Dash_Sad__But then i had to put it down. I was sent home before i could Finish it.
Rainbow_Dash_Sad__But there's no thing that's worth as much to me as a friend.
Rainbow_Dash_Sad__But, it didn't happen.
Rainbow_Dash_Sad__But, it looks like i ruined your chances instead.

Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_And because my crew are such tight friends, they followed me!
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_And heard you flying towards me and muttering from a mile away.

Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_Being a hero is surely not for everypony.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_But guess who was at the top of the reserve list?
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_But i didn't let that stop me.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_But i'm feeling extra, extra powerful today.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_But, it's gonna take a lot more than some Shadowy ghost pony to get me to leave.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_C'mon, slowpokes! you wanna win, don't ya?
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_Clearing things up is one of my specialties.

Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_I have just saved that grass.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_I hear you're looking for my cutie mark story.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_I mean, i could beat the whole town of appleloosa at buckball With one wing tied behind my back.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_I need a cheering section to match my spectacular performance.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_I probably know more than most ponies, So that makes me an expert.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_I still would have won even without my wings.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_I thought so!
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_I'm not!
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_I'm not! i knew we were the best!
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_I'm pretty sure every creature's gonna like it a lot better than pounding nails and cutting wood.

Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_I've flown through it a million times myself, so, obviously i'll be at the front of the pack.

Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_Some of the greatest pegasi in history came from cloudsdale.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_Sorry boys.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_Sounds like sour apples to me.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_That's true, in ponyville!
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_The object of the game is to get the closest to the stake.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_The one and only.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_Then leave the rest, to us!
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_There's only room on team dash for one of you, and my future pet needs to be able to take it to the extreme!
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_They don't call me Rainbow, and dash, for nothing.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_Thinking back on it, I acted pretty awesomely heroic that day.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_This way, i can stay focused on performing those acts of bravery That nopony else has the guts to perform.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_Those pony pox are clearing right up.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_Told ya!
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_Tough day? please. if i can pull off a sonic rainboom.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_Trust me, this is gonna work like a charm!
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_Twilight, not everypony gets all freaked out about tests like you.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_Uh, so smokey gave us bad dreams.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_Uh, yeah, because we wanted your party to be a surprise.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_Um, we've all faced a lot worse than baby magic.

Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_Weeds that were attempting to eat this lawn.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_Well, mare do well, Or should i call you mare do slow.

Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_Why? you heard of me?
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_Wow, you must be slow if all spike had to do to win Was fall down.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_Yeah! let's see you beat that!
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_Yeah, right! i got this one nailed.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_Yeah, yeah, the wonderbolts history test. no big deal.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_Yeah. i'm kind of an expert.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_Yeah. takes guts. But it also takes brains. And sometimes, a big lunch and a nap.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_You would think that, twilight. and that's why you would never qualify to be my pet.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_You're gonna have to write down a new record.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_You're putting on a brave face, I get it. But you don't have to anymore, I'll help you cross the street.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_You're such a rookie.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_You've had your fun, but i think you and i both know who made the cut and who didn't.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_but i've got plans.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_caught you right in the nick of time.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_from the looks of it, Just locking up the games for the crystal empire is all.

Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_heh. no problem! i've totally got your flank.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_heh. trust me. the game's a lot harder to play with apples.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_i did kick some major tail at the academy.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_make way for the ironpony!
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_of course, being a wonderbolt takes up Most of my time so.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_ten seconds flat.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_that doesn't mean i can't swoop in and save you From time to time.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_try matching that!
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_we totally just wiped the castle with that guy.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_well, we are kind of an awesome team.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_yeah i mean, Unless you don't want to help applejack.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Noisy_yeah, i am.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Aim high, kid, but don't aim for the impossible.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_And i'm gonna show them my stuff.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_And kazaam! this sweet baby appeared As fast as lightning.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_And that leg is.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_And there goes winter, down the drain!
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_And will have earned the honor, and glory, of getting to be my pet!
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Anypony can make a mistake.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_But i'm far too busy saving lives to stop and write.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_But i'm up to the challenge.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_But if you're feel like talking about how great i am, Don't let me stop you.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_But that day, the day i discovered racing, I proved that the legends were true.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_But with my name permanently etched onto them.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Can't catch me!
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Easy peasy. my game is officially back on.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Easy, peasy, one two threesy! right guys?
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Fine, if you ponies want effort, Then that's just what you'll get.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Good luck beating that, fluttershy!
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Good thing i didn't, cause it gave me a chance to show her how important it is To put your trust in somepony else.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Ha! take that, mare do well.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Ha. I suppose you want me to thank.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Ha. shows what you know about chillaxing.

Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Hah, stopping winter is gonna be a breeze!
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_How would you describe what i just did? Would you say i was amazing?
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_I can't understand you with that rope in your mouth.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_I know that i can pick up the slack for anypony.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_I sure hope you're not afraid of the dark, applejack!
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_I wouldn't be surprised If they just went ahead and made me a wonderbolt On the first day.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_I'm probably the best flyer in all of equestria.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_I've proven i'm one of the best flyers around.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_If any of you don't think you can handle it, bow out now before you humiliate yourself in front of your peers.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_If only somepony were here to pat me on the back.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Look, ma, no wings!
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Looks like ponyville needs a hero.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Looks like we're gonna have to do this the hard way.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Maybe for your normal, run of the mill ponies.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Need a place to put these guys!
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Never fear your friendly neighbor.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Nice one, rainbow.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Nice try.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_No wings?
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Not for a pony who can fly.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Nothing nice about it.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Of course i am.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Of course. i just thought you might need this.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Oh! i forgot to tell you! watch out for the koray eels!
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Oopsie! looks like these were a little loose!
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Or, mudslide in your case.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Pardon me! excuse me!
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Plus, i don't believe in ghosts.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Pretty lame move. is that all they've got?
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Puh lease, twilight. that was the worst sneak attack ever.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Same spectacular hooves. Nope, i'm still awesome.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_See? i'd never leave my friends hanging.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_So, do i need to remind you of what our goal is here?
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Sooner i get there, sooner i get to show off my stuff!
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Tank's not some fuzzy little bunny.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Thank you! thank you!
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_That's because you're tough, Just like when i was your age.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_That's just 'cause you wimpy unicorns know you'd never win.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_The other wonderbolts will have to keep up, Or eat my cloud trail.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_They don't like it when you get too close to their nests, like this!
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_They think they can beat the two of us?
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_This competition isn't for the weak. you'd better be prepared to step up your game!
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_To get a second opinion from a real reptile expert.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Try to keep up!
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Up here!
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Wait a minute. i do have a leg up on her.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_We have so got this. i'm gonna go sign us in.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_We'll see about that!
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Well, i know all about super strong flying!
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Well, we'll just see about that!
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_With me on the team, we'll qualify. i'm sure of it.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Wonder which medal that was?
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Yeah, i'm pretty awesome.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Yeah, it's okay, but it's no cloudsdale mobile!
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Yeah, yeah. I've got a good ten seconds to spare. Just a couple more.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_Yeah? well, we've got the cure for that!
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_You didn't think i was gonna let you off that easy, did you?
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_You'd better let me handle this, ma'am. For your own safety, i must ask you to stand back.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_You're gonna have to pick up the pace If you want to compete with me, 'cause i move like lightning.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_and we keep telling bad guys.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_apple snack.
Rainbow_Dash_Smug_Very Noisy_i can totally fly up there and bust those puppies, no problem.

Rarity_Amused_Noisy_Honestly, you two.
Rarity_Amused_Noisy_I'm sure there'll be plenty of other chances for you to share in the kind of frivolity we had with discord while you were away.
Rarity_Amused_Noisy_It almost sounded like you said she did say that.
Rarity_Amused_Noisy_It doesn't matter who else i asked.

Rarity_Angry_Very Noisy_I beg your pardon, but what pray tell are you doing?
Rarity_Angry_Very Noisy_I waited all my life.
Rarity_Angry_Very Noisy_I wish that star would burn out!
Rarity_Angry_Very Noisy_Of all the castles in equestria, this is by far the most ungrateful!
Rarity_Angry_Very Noisy_Put me down!
Rarity_Angry_Very Noisy_Put me down, you brute!
Rarity_Angry_Very Noisy_Sweetie belle!
Rarity_Angry_Very Noisy_The big deal is that in the heat of the sun, wool.

Rarity_Annoyed Sarcastic_Noisy_Does this look messed up to you?
Rarity_Annoyed Sarcastic_Noisy_Where she keeps all her rainbow dash trophies?
Rarity_Annoyed Sarcastic_Very Noisy_Obviously, fluttershy's just too busy with her new career to spend time with her best friend.
Rarity_Annoyed Sarcastic_Very Noisy_Who was that again oh, right! That's you!

Rarity_Annoyed Shouting__A little bit dirty!
Rarity_Annoyed Smug__What does a bird know about architectural design?
Rarity_Annoyed Whispering_Noisy_I am running out of weaving materials for the traditional crafts booth!
Rarity_Annoyed Whispering_Noisy_It's muddying my concentration.
Rarity_Annoyed Whispering_Very Noisy_Get up.
Rarity_Annoyed Whispering__I have to make the bed again so the blanket will be right.
Rarity_Annoyed Whispering__I just made a hat out of three pieces of hay and a drinking straw!
Rarity_Annoyed Whispering__Unh unh unh. you'll ruin it.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Again.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_All of you riffraff are trespassing in unicornia.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_An apology?
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_And i want to know now!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_And i'm going to go and give her a piece of my mind!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_And it's all applejack's fault!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_And please find something to do That doesn't create a large mess for me to clean up.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_And then there was the time rainbow dash Called my cloudsdale couture boutique idea impractical!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Another old, Have you lost your mind?
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Applejack, why do you have to be so good And make me look so bad?
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_At least you can fly across.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_But every time i make a mess, you get upset.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_But you don't.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_But you said, fashion is ridiculous!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_But, what kind of friendship school is this?
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Calm down, applejack.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Careful! you're gonna spill that on me!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Clover the clever, throw that brute into the dungeon!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Come with me!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Come, on!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Darling, do these look like usual carts to you?
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Even if we did find our way back to the castle, we'd still have all of those.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Farm, thing!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Guess it's time to see what all the fuss is about.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Hardly!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Hmph!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Hold it right there, mister small and handsome.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_How are we supposed to get to it?
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_How dare you let me get what i want.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_I am perfectly familiar with the applebucking process, thank you very much.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_I am still your big sister.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_I am way too generous to let you out friend me like that!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_I can't believe we're wasting our time Talking to a tacky window.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_I don't know what i was thinking wearing this ridiculous outfit.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_I don't socialize with dragons.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_I don't want to make another hundred princess dresses!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_I found it, and it's mine, fair and square!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_I have no intention of arriving at my new land Looking like a bedraggled earth pony, Or worse yet, a rough and tumble.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_I heard that.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_I know her better than anypony!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_I know what you're up to.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_I mean, accusing me of not knowing her!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_I mean, really.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_I would like to know what in a wide wide realm of equestria this stunt of yours is all about.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_I'm going to call you repeatie belle!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_I'm sorry, spike. Some of us do have standards.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_If you can't be bothered to read the thing i like, That just further illustrates the point That we have nothing in common anymore!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_If you insist.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Indeed not.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_It is the opposite of ok.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_It's no use!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Keep your envious little eyes off it!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Let's dispense with the charade, shall we?
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Let's do it again.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Listen, spooky eyes!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Look at those drapes!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Mysterious presences, And unappreciative castles!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_No matter. i'm going to give her quite the talking to!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_No, it is I who have been trying my best.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Not to mention the day i was wearing a really gorgeous hat, And rainbow dash didn't even notice.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Now stop right there! Let's not let things descend into petty insults.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Now, make up flyers for a going out of business sale!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Of course.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Oh Fluttershy, would you be a dear and fly faster please?
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Oh for goodness sakes, maud!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Oh please, miss pie! this is hardly the time for jokes!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Oh! oh! Pinkie, what are you doing?
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Oh, be quiet.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Oh, please. I think i know a disguise when i see one. Take off that ridiculous beard!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Oh, you were serious.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Pinkie pie!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Playing silly little games in the dirt is just uncouth.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Please, commander, Could you just stand back and give me my royal space?
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Put the pens and pencils back exactly where you found them.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Rainbow dash! could you please refrain from all that racket?
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Rarity i was expecting an audience with the princess, Not, outdoor sports.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_She stranded us in the middle of the ocean!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Spike's style is unique. He doesn't have to look like other dragons.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Stay out of trouble, okay?
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Still rude.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Sweetie belle, what am i going to do with you!?
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Take that, you ruffian!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Thanks to sweetie belle.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_That rock is clearly On the unicornia side of the cave, And it belongs to us.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_That's barbaric.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_That's not what i meant!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_That's thirty five games in a row.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_The big deal, is that it will be very difficult to show maud What a strong fashion presence we have in ponyville.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Then some dented tin that cooked a pie a whole two seconds faster!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_They may not be as sophisticated as some of you canterlot ponies.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Turns out there's a club pony party palace upstairs.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Ugh. foals today listen to their, so called music, Far too loud.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Unlike you pegasi ruffians, We unicorns would never stoop to such a thing.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_We will no longer consort with the likes of them.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_We've come all this way and for what?
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Well there you are. haven't i told you about punctuality?
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Well, it's not going to work!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Well, no matter.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Well, she did write the book on it?
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Well, tapestries or no, i have had just about enough of secret passages.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_What's gotten into you!?
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_What, did you say?
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Where's her silly, little arts and crafts project?
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Which, as horrible as it is, i can almost understand Because you're a dragon and all.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Why don't you take a picture? It will last longer!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_With or without a sister.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Yes it is!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_You can be generous with all sorts of things. Gifts, compliments, your time.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_You can help by picking up these papers And stacking them. neatly.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_You did that on purpose.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_You ever hear of personal space!?
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_You leave him alone, rainbow dash!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_You see this invisible line?
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_You're going to get what you want!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_You're scratching up my coat with those jagged things.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Your point?
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_Zephyr! i asked you to do this job.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_ah! so, he could have ended the whole sombra thing, whenever he wanted?
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_and somepony refused to relax until she had fixed them.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_applejack, i thought you closed all the windows.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_et tu, gabby gums?
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_honestly rainbow dash.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_imagine that.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_quit it.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_stay out of trouble, okay?
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_then how are we meant to shake down ne'er do wells For information!?
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_to answer your rather rude question, They're going as our dates, our plus ones!
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_unappreciative right now.
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_what in the name of celestia was that!?
Rarity_Annoyed_Noisy_you just said psst.
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_A little bit dirty.
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_A turkey call?
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_After all the effort i put in to provide her and pinkie With the exact luxury cruise they needed To get out of their elements.
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_And just look what her playing did to poor fluttershy.
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_And there is nothing you can do to keep me From my sacred task of restoration!
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_And this air is stifling, suffocating!
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_And tricking us all into being the opposite of our true selves.
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_And when i try to get a deep breath, the stench of all you dogs makes me nauseated.
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_And why would you waste a perfectly good hors d'oeuvre?
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Apparently, dj pon three has a residency At the party palace upstairs, But security won't let me speak to her!
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Applejack clearly caused the boat to sink!
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_But i am far too busy to entertain Some tourist's ridiculous fantasies.
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_But i came in second. second!
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_But your wall art is in an atrocious state!
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Can we please stop running!?
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Cleaning up this mess somepony made!
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Do you know how hard it is to stitch a pineapple pattern?
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Don't be ridiculous!
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Don't touch my gem!
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Get away from my gem! Get away!
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Glad i didn't bother wearing my fanciest outfit.
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Good grief! this isn't working.
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Good heavens! what is that smell?
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Half of them are traps!
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Hasn't anypony heard of beauty sleep?
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Hello? what's this?
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_How ridiculous!
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_How rude.
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Huh? what are you doing? Hey! you spilled my drink.
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_I am complaining.
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_I am not whining.
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_I don't want to hear it.
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_I for one would appreciate an explanation.
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_I just can't believe that sweetie belle.

Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_That was rude!

Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_When was the last time you two had a manicure?
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_While i am crowded and cramped in the same car With all the other ponies.
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Would somepony kindly explain What is the meaning of all this water?
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Yes, desperate times do call For desperate measures.
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_You are very old and very scary.
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_You could all do with a good round of soap and water.
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_You didn't like that much, did you?
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_You look and smell like you haven't bathed in weeks. Have you never heard of soap?
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_You lost your voice doing a.
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_You really shouldn't be snooping, rarity.
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_You've got a luxurious private sleeper car for a tree.

Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_a Turkey call?
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_and at this point i'm considering soaking my hooves in one of the machines so my time here isn't a total loss.
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_and i am not about to chip a hoof Because you dislike my style of digging.
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_and what are you suggesting?
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_applejack actually, although i'm quite sure she'll be too busy once again.
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_but it's no fissure in the sidewalk.
Rarity_Annoyed_Very Noisy_i am sick of being lost in these slimy corridors too, But you shouldn't pull every lever you come across!

Rarity_Annoyed__I thought we agreed never to speak of that again.
Rarity_Annoyed__I'm going to have to pay, aren't i?
Rarity_Annoyed__I'm starting to wonder if maybe this castle doesn't want my expertise!
Rarity_Annoyed__Is it a crime to change one's style now and again?
Rarity_Annoyed__Is it because you were Insulted when i insulted your Hair?
Rarity_Annoyed__Just two? i thought you said you could pack a place With ponies no matter what!
Rarity_Annoyed__Just who does she think she is?

Rarity_Annoyed__That is how applejack thanked me.
Rarity_Annoyed__That still doesn't excuse a certain pony's behavior.
Rarity_Annoyed__That's not even a word.
Rarity_Annoyed__That, is what's wrong.
Rarity_Annoyed__This is impossible.
Rarity_Annoyed__Ugh! very well.
Rarity_Annoyed__We've been through this.

Rarity_Annoyed__only saving your ungrateful scales!
Rarity_Annoyed__uh!
Rarity_Annoyed__you could at least say, excuse me.
Rarity_Anxious Angry_Noisy_How could gabby gums possibly get access to my private diary!?
Rarity_Anxious Annoyed_Noisy_Do you have any idea how important this job is to me?
Rarity_Anxious Annoyed_Noisy_Fluttershy, what are you doing? That's no way to behave.

Rarity_Anxious Annoyed_Very Noisy_Careful, Twilight.
Rarity_Anxious Annoyed_Very Noisy_No! that bunting is embroidered by hoof! don't you move one more paw!
Rarity_Anxious Annoyed__I even started hoping that you would do something silly so your modeling career would be over.
Rarity_Anxious Annoyed__You must tell me when they add these sorts of things!
Rarity_Anxious Confused_Noisy_And how could you possibly make all of those outfits out of it so fast!?
Rarity_Anxious Confused_Noisy_Awful?

Rarity_Anxious Confused_Noisy_I don't understand, applejack.
Rarity_Anxious Confused_Noisy_Uh, we?
Rarity_Anxious Confused_Noisy_What is this? is it a tunnel? where does it lead?

Rarity_Anxious Crazy__No time for breakfast!
Rarity_Anxious Happy_Noisy_You'd, do that? fluttershy, you'll handle those.
Rarity_Anxious Sad_Noisy_And then she turned it into a wardrobe just like mine.
Rarity_Anxious Sad_Noisy_But then, when it started happening, all I could think was, how could I want you to fail at something you love so much?
Rarity_Anxious Sad_Noisy_I let one of the other contestants use some of my one of a kind fabric.
Rarity_Anxious Sad_Noisy_What? i really mean it this time.
Rarity_Anxious Sad_Noisy_only now it looks like i'm the one copying her!
Rarity_Anxious Sad_Very Noisy_How can i possibly finish my latest creation if i can't find it?
Rarity_Anxious Sad__My friends!

Rarity_Anxious Shouting_Very Noisy_Stop!
Rarity_Anxious Shouting_Very Noisy_There's no other way!
Rarity_Anxious Shouting_Very Noisy_You're making a terrible mistake!
Rarity_Anxious Shouting_Very Noisy_how could My own sister steal my private diary!?
Rarity_Anxious Shouting_Very Noisy_twilight! there's something wrong with spike!
Rarity_Anxious Shouting_Very Noisy_you might want to come over here for a second!

Rarity_Anxious Tired_Very Noisy_Oh, i'm here, i'm here!
Rarity_Anxious Tired_Very Noisy_Spike, darling, you'll have to forgive me. I'm far too emotionally drained to discuss The matter any further.
Rarity_Anxious Whispering_Noisy_Although i do so wish that anything had turned out to be something else.
Rarity_Anxious Whispering_Noisy_Attitude and pizzazz!
Rarity_Anxious Whispering_Noisy_The food is excellent but, i'm not sure there's much You and i can do to help them.
Rarity_Anxious Whispering_Noisy_Think of your reputation.
Rarity_Anxious Whispering_Noisy_Twilight, maybe i should take over the investigation.
Rarity_Anxious Whispering_Noisy_You're right. we promised we wouldn't let anything ruin their visit.
Rarity_Anxious Whispering_Noisy_ok, what's the secret?
Rarity_Anxious Whispering_Very Noisy_I hope twilight and pinkie pie Are having more luck with the baby!
Rarity_Anxious Whispering_Very Noisy_These two? oh i don't know, darling.
Rarity_Anxious Whispering__He'll get clobbered!
Rarity_Anxious Whispering__I don't know if they believe you.
Rarity_Anxious Whispering__Spikey wikey is going to stay with these awful dragons, forever?
Rarity_Anxious Whispering__We can't let little spikey wikey wrestle one of them!
Rarity_Anxious Whispering__apparently applejack won't consider starting her time at the spa without a steam, and we only have an hour.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_A better question would be, what isn't the matter?
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Aah! Somepony stepped on her!
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Absolutely horrendous!
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_After all, Who doesn't like the smell of cake frosting?
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Ah! pinkie, i can't have photo finish shoot my mane like this!
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_All of those unfinished seams.

Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_And the cornerstone piece of my collection, just isn't working!
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_And the runway ballroom is all the way across town!
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_And they're ghastly creatures!
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_And this party string won't come off!
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_And we'll manage glowing teeth and car horns And disorganized clothes and dance music. Am i forgetting anything?
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_And, that's ok!
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Awful?
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Back to work. i must create.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Big mac, did you lose your voice?
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Breakfast, a big breakfast.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_But i can't find it anywhere!
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_But i can't possibly disappoint the canterlot elite by rejecting their invitations now, can i?
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_But i don't know if i can even show my face looking like this.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_But i still wanted you to see this show.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_But if the vampire bats aren't eating your apples.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_But it is you. you love puppet shows and dressing up And taking silly photos and tiny little clown shaped ice creams!
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_But it's not!
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_But nonetheless you can't throw away this chance. You must do this for me.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_But not the kind we're looking for i'm afraid.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_But sweetie belle, darling, i'm behind as it is!
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_But, but receiving orders for one hundred dresses in one day, I-it's just too much, too soon!
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_But, but.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_But, the outfit descriptions are an integral part of the plot Of the colt in crimson.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Can i get anypony more punch?
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Can't you do a spell that restores some semblance Of my mane!?
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Canterlot fashion show or no, i simply can't leave fluttershy To fend for herself with these manehattanites!
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Check! re check! re check and re check!
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Con, twilight's party Might not be as sophisticated as the derby, But that doesn't mean i shouldn't put all of my energy Into creating her birthday ensemble.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Darling, this time i really do have to agree with rainbow dash.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Darling, your diorama!
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Dear, dear, spike!

Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Have you met my sister and her friends?
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_He, really loves getting his face, painted.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Heavens, no! We're getting dressed.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Hold on a minute.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Honestly, how hard is it to pretend it's not so bad?
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_How about, now?
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_How are we meant to rein discord in if we can't use the elements to turn him back to stone?
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_How are you going to help me, shine across equestria, if I don't design something new for these pictures?
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Huh? opal?
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Hurry rarity, but not too fast.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I always put on something a little fancy When, opal's feeling under the weather. Cheers her right up.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I appreciate the offer, but this is manehattan.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I beg your pardon for cutting it so close.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I can't believe it, i thought you went back home!
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I can't believe we lost her.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I can't lose him! i can't! he's everything i imagined!
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I could hand them now but, i might have to redo them.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I did! i totally forgot them!
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I didn't want you to think i was being rude, So that's exactly the reason i didn't tell you!
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I don't understand. the map summoned us here To solve a friendship problem.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I don't want to lose him.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I guess i've been so busy running my shop.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I had hoped dressing the part would help me feel the part.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I hate to add to your already overflowing plate Of responsibilities.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I have to go.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I have to rush back to ponyville but i just wanted to thank her first for.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I hope a k yearling's alright.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I hope you don't expect me to.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I just don't understand why, fluttershy.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I just hope i brought enough to trade.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I just remembered something!
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I knew you wouldn't side with those, icky bats.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I know it's not the pie tin you were after.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I need a moment with prim hemline.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I need an actual mane!
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I need them for an outfit for an extremely important client!
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I never meant to.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I only meant to take a little, lady like bite.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I really should go check on opal.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I simply cannot find anything suitable to wear.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I suddenly understood why I've been getting.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I suppose that's true, And i do have a lot of work to do.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I suppose, i could, give it a shot.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I think i heard something.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I thought the crystal heart had dispelled him Into the ether!
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I was just about finished planning my new fashion line.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I was so wrapped up in my work That i forgot you were bringing opalescence back From her grooming.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I well, i you know, the truth is.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I'll never get him interested in the festival.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I'm just happy you're all still here after how i treated you.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I'm sorry i can't invite you to stay and chat, fluttershy.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I'm sure a big, brave, powerful, And rich monster, i mean, Minotaur, like you.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I'm sure to find some shortcuts.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I'm sure you're right.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I'm, flattered, really.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I've lost a lot of time And i cannot have any more interruptions.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I, certainly hope, all of this dreadful dust, was worth it!
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I, i think so.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I-i can't remember. has it been that long?
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_I-i don't need lessons on being a good sister, I-i promise!
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_If i don't get there, i'm disqualified!
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_If i had the remover potion this whole time.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_If we don't open tonight, it won't be.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Is everypony ready for the grand re re opening?
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Is something wrong, spike?
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_It means that i've taken on more work than i can handle.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_It was such a pretty little chiffon!
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_It wouldn't necessarily mean princess celestia and princess luna will return.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_It's almost time.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_It's completely disorganized.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_It's important that you know that i am not pointing hooves.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_It's just i have a project I really need to get started on, and.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_It's just that.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_It's up to you.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Just as soon as i stop that pony in the shop over there From purchasing that dreadfully hideous scarf!
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Just look at it. it's dreadful!
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Let's get started. apparently, there's not a moment to lose.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Let's uh, let them finish their work.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Like it or love it?
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Listen, i'll show you how to cook my favorite quiche.

Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Nothing.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Now i have to go and find some more of these gems.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Now we can't perform tonight!
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Of all the worst things that could happen, this is.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Oh but don't be cold!
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Oh but those brighten up the whole room!
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Oh darling i'm afraid i can't stop.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_Oh darling i'm afraid we've literally run out of time.

Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_what do you think of the place? is this the right location? did i pick a good spot?
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_working in a space this small would make me lose my mind.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_yeah.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_yes, uh, great.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_you can't! you musn't!
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_you know, the second part where i said pinkie pie had to give something up.
Rarity_Anxious_Noisy_zecora might not be able To fix this in time for the shoot!
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_After i think of a way to quiet down that music.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_Again, i-i'm really sorry i bumped into you.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_Always check and re check.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_And after i finish designing the window display.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_And i had a terrible time with these froofy sleeves.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_And while i do agree that this dress has potential, I've not had enough time to give it enough love to become couture.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_And, might i add, what a lovely establishment you have here!
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_Are you sure it's a good idea to team up with ember?
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_As in starting this very instant this week?
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_B-b-but these are extremely rare baby blue sapphires!
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_Because.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_But i hope that burping dragon wins.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_But i hope you like it.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_But i made some improvements to your original design.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_But i rather like the.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_But i've got such a long to do list.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_But if i don't go, My new reputation in canterlot as a very important pony Might be ruined!
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_But if i go, i'll miss twilight's birthday.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_But of course, i couldn't possibly do it all on my own.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_But this is business!
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_But this party doesn't even seem have a proper theme!
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_Can we all please, argue at a lower volume?
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_Come with me before you catch a cold!
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_Coriander, i understand your trepidation.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_Darling, are you all right?
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_Does, does that mean practice went well, yesterday?

Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_Fashion runway ballroom, seven minutes. can you make it!?
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_Feel better, my sweet. we'll manage without you, somehow.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_Fluttershy had a point with the layers on the dress.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_Fluttershy, are you in there?
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_Fluttershy, we must talk to you.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_Forget avant garde! i should have said en garde!
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_Friend's birthday, very important pony.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_Go out there and sell it!
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_Hello? the door appears to be stuck.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_How am i ever gonna get this done?
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_How did this happen? that's what i don't understand.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_How will i handle them all?
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_I can't say for how much longer.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_I don't think i could have met trenderhoof on my own.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_I don't want those big, ugly, nasty dragons to hurt one little scale On your cutsey wutsey head!
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_I have to get started right away.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_I have to go.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_I hope!
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_I know! i know!
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_I might never be invited To another high society event again!
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_I stand corrected! i suppose there is the rare instance where one can have too many sequins.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_I suppose, this won't do either?
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_I think i'll just go see how rainbow dash is doing.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_I think we may have a problem.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_I'll have plenty of time to figure out exactly how to, do this.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_I'll just take off my jacket.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_I'll need three gallons of boling water and one ounce of detergent, stat!
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_I'm afraid getting a taxi at this time could prove almost impossible!
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_I'm sure i could work my magic and turn it into something fabulous.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_I, figured.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_I-i was just.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_If the most fashion forward pony here can't keep her hat from falling apart!
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_Imagine her mane turned into a porcupine.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_Is that him? is he here? twilight, is he there?
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_It doesn't sound, hmm, very clean.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_It is for the first play you ever wrote, after all.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_It's just, i'm dreadfully busy preparing For tonight's grand opening, as you can see.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_It's so plain it's frightening.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_Let's just hope they don't convert any of us first.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_Look!
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_Looking for perfection here.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_Me?
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_More light! it has to catch the sequins just so or the whole outfit is just a disaster.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_Must, get to the, center.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_No no no no! but that's not what zesty wants!
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_No no no, i can't have a family of rubbish scented Raccoons, living in my boutique.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_No time to talk. i have to find my friends!
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_No! no.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_No! zesty will hate it!
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_Not quite.

Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_Oh, it's for an ensemble i'm making for a friend. Her birthday's in a few days.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_Oh, my shoes will be ruined forever!

Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_Opalescence delivered your message, twilight. What's the emergency?
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_Out there on the runway.

Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_You don't know her too well.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_You don't suppose he has decided not to come?
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_a little help here?
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_but i can't help you unless you tell me what the problem is.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_but it does go very well with your complexion.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_but we're also about to be frozen solid!
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_but, but that party cannon is your everything!
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_delicious.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_did you lose it?
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_excuse me, pardon me.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_i can clearly see that something's bothering you and i want to help.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_i know how good you two are at giving gifts.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_i-it certainly is cozy, but this simply won't do.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_if you ask me, it's already a total disaster.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_is your party cannon lost somewhere in the big city?
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_maybe if you catch up with him, you could ask.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_oh applejack honestly, can't we just start with a hooficure? we're going to run out of time!
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_oh my gosh. i can't believe i'm saying this,.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_oh, Well, it's just, i believe that is a dish towel.

Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_we can't just leave them here, all possessed and sombrafied.
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_we have to do something!
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_what?
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_you absolutely love that cannon, how could you possibly part with something that means so much to you?
Rarity_Anxious_Very Noisy_you think so?
Rarity_Anxious__Ah, yes. well um, there is a bit of a challenge.
Rarity_Anxious__All this time.
Rarity_Anxious__Am i?
Rarity_Anxious__And i saw him in the shop buying pillows and blankets.
Rarity_Anxious__And i thought if i told you how jealous I was of your success you'd think I was a terrible friend.
Rarity_Anxious__And our lead actress is!
Rarity_Anxious__And that's your right.
Rarity_Anxious__And twilight sparkle of course.
Rarity_Anxious__And we're still not sure.
Rarity_Anxious__Appleloosa is far too long a train ride for young foals without accompaniment.
Rarity_Anxious__Are you certain that's safe?
Rarity_Anxious__Are you sure you are up for it?
Rarity_Anxious__As twilight's good friends, we should have taken her feelings seriously and been there for her.
Rarity_Anxious__Bad? this is worse than i could have possibly imagined!
Rarity_Anxious__But apart, all we are is just a pile of mush And some crumbly, dry mess.
Rarity_Anxious__But but but That's ridiculous!
Rarity_Anxious__But but but the dragonlands are full of, dragons!
Rarity_Anxious__But remember that rotten garble?
Rarity_Anxious__But why?
Rarity_Anxious__But won't she start worrying if you aren't at the train station when she gets here?
Rarity_Anxious__But, but, but how?
Rarity_Anxious__But.
Rarity_Anxious__Con, going to the derby cuts into The amount of time i have to finish twilight's outfit.
Rarity_Anxious__Did you use.
Rarity_Anxious__Didn't the play go all right?
Rarity_Anxious__Do you not like the shape?
Rarity_Anxious__Go Twilight! Get help!
Rarity_Anxious__Golly, what a splendid idea!
Rarity_Anxious__H-hoity toity?
Rarity_Anxious__Have you told him?
Rarity_Anxious__He's coming here?
Rarity_Anxious__Hello, uh, girls.
Rarity_Anxious__How awful is it?
Rarity_Anxious__How do we stop a disaster if we don't know what it is?
Rarity_Anxious__I assure you they're quite a handful.
Rarity_Anxious__I can't believe we nearly lost pinkie pie to that ridiculous obstacle course.
Rarity_Anxious__I couldn't help myself! it was just begging for the personal touch!
Rarity_Anxious__I hate to be the bearer of more bad news, but it's almost sunset!
Rarity_Anxious__I hate to let them down.
Rarity_Anxious__I just hope it isn't too late.
Rarity_Anxious__I just need to figure out how.
Rarity_Anxious__I just wish you'd realized it Before you ruined the fashion show!
Rarity_Anxious__I just won't have any time to watch you if i want to get these robes delivered on time.
Rarity_Anxious__I must find the silk!
Rarity_Anxious__I only tried to do what i thought you wanted.
Rarity_Anxious__I should probably go talk to her, hm?
Rarity_Anxious__I suppose If i got a few more ponies to help me, then maybe.
Rarity_Anxious__I think i left the bath water running in my suite.
Rarity_Anxious__I understand.
Rarity_Anxious__I wanted all the attention, And instead it was going to you.
Rarity_Anxious__I was wondering when all of you were going to show up.
Rarity_Anxious__I'd prefer not to get my hooves muddy.
Rarity_Anxious__I'd worked out exactly how much time I needed to weave my star spider sash, and now I'm behind!
Rarity_Anxious__I'm gonna have to work all night.
Rarity_Anxious__I'm jealous!
Rarity_Anxious__I'm not sure that's, exactly the word i would use.
Rarity_Anxious__I'm not sure we did.
Rarity_Anxious__I'm sure she will be along in any moment.
Rarity_Anxious__I'm the cosmare cover pony.
Rarity_Anxious__I've bitten off a bit more than i can chew with this order.
Rarity_Anxious__I've got twenty of these special robes to make tonight.
Rarity_Anxious__I've lost my diamond encrusted purple ribbon!
Rarity_Anxious__I, had a big lunch.
Rarity_Anxious__If celestia is going to be in our play.
Rarity_Anxious__If i can't convince him that i'm just as much of a farmhoof as applejack.
Rarity_Anxious__If we don't figure this out soon it's going to Look like we didn't lift a hoof to help her!
Rarity_Anxious__Is she still coming?
Rarity_Anxious__It doesn't?
Rarity_Anxious__Just what are we doing to do?
Rarity_Anxious__Just, lucky i guess.
Rarity_Anxious__My hair!

Rarity_Anxious__Nice?
Rarity_Anxious__Nice?
Rarity_Anxious__No! She can't possibly be crowned without wearing her coronation gown!

Rarity_Anxious__Nopony has the right to tell these ponies what to think.
Rarity_Anxious__Not them! they're my favorite too!
Rarity_Anxious__Not, bad.
Rarity_Anxious__Nothing.
Rarity_Anxious__Of all the worst things that could happen.

Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_Her name, was mistmane.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_Her stories are always full of mystery, and suspense, And best of all, fabulous costumes!
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_Here i was about to give up.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_Here you are.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_Here's what i'm thinking.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_Hey eyepatch!
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_His princely side is sure to come out if you're just patient.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_Hm, not that i can think of.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_Hm, that's odd. The only time the map's called all of us to one place Was starlight's village.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_Hmm, shame you weren't called as well though darling.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_Hmm.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_Hmm. she's going to want to see attitude, and pizzazz.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_Hmm? oh, sorry darling! wearing this drab jersey gave me an idea For a buckball inspired line of athleisure wear.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_Hmmm. i'm genuinely not sure. are they too in style?
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_Hoity toity and iconic fashion photographer photo finish, to come to ponyville and judge the show.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_Hoity toity has expertise in fabric and stitchwork.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_Honestly, you really are such a disappointment.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_How do i put this delicately?
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I admit, applejack is an unorthodox choice.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I am flattered that you would Think about me, though.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I am now modelling, the rather, unattractive and, frankly itchy, original wonderbolts flying costume.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I am simply lending a hoof for the chores.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I am.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I believe shadow spade herself would approve.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I can focus on the thing i'm worried about most of all.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I can meet my goals.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I can't believe you thought any of us would send you away because of some silly molt effect.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I can't get near her without getting a swipe from her claws.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I certainly did. I learned how important it is to keep your hooves on the ground.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I couldn't decide between the boots and the stilettos, so i got both.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I designed my own cart when i was just a filly.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I do appreciate you showing me the way to the phoenix's nests, spike.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I do wish zecora lived in town.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I don't know how you keep all of those orders straight.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I don't know how you know my name.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I don't know why i ever thought you wouldn't understand.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I don't like to judge solely on appearances.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I don't seem to need it anymore, do i?
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I find that nothing brightens my mood like a new ensemble!
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I give lessons, reasonable demands.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I had no idea you had such distaste for cucumbers.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I have always believed that the right outfit can make up for Any other areas that are lacking.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I hear the only thing that sparkles more than a dragon's scales, are the jewels they use to build their nests.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I hope that incredibly pungent odor belongs to some sort of magical curative.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I just need some time alone.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I just saved that poor pony from committing a terrible crime of fashion.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I just wish pinkie pie were here so we could tell her How much we all appreciate her hard work.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I know rainbow, and i'm on this case like a charm on a bracelet!
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I know so!
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I know you're excited about the filly guide cookie drive.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I know you're swamped, but it's for vanity mare. She's going to take pictures of my mane, So color coordination is a must.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I learned that no matter where you go in life, You should never forget that you are the product Of your home and your friends.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I made the purchase entirely with my own bits.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I need you to trust me.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I never should have treated your interests Like they were worth less than mine.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I promise you'll absolutely adore the headdress as soon as you see it.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I promised i'd give you gems to snack on.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I really don't see what the fuss is all about.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I refuse to get my gown wet.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I remember because it clashed with the font on the menus.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I remember how difficult it was to break into the fashion Industry when i was starting out.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I shan't succumb to such fabulousness.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I simply cannot imagine why the pegasus ponies would schedule a dreadful downpour this evening and ruin what could have been a glorious sunny day.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I still don't understand how flim and flam Could have gotten a copy of your book.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I suppose i could.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I suppose not.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I suppose these ruins are chock full of them.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I take it from your reaction that you like the boutique?
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I think i feel a pimple coming on. Oh! Only one solution!
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I think not!
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I think not!
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I think the girls have earned a little celebration For all of their hard work.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I think we need to look into this school.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I think you may still have some baking to do.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I think you'll find her work is worth reading Before you dismiss it out of hoof.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I think, what applejack is trying to say is that there's something, unappealing about a pony Who changes themselves so much just to impress somepony else.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I tried every trick i could think of.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I want to return those sewing machines, I need the bits if i'm going to keep advancing here.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I want to thank you all for coming out tonight and generously Supporting the ponyville pet center.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I was going to save it to the end, but.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I was wondering if you could tell her how you feel About apples?
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I will be the better friend.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I will give it everything i've got!
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I would expect nothing less.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I would like to welcome you, again, to the grand opening Of canterlot carousel.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I would very much like that.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I'll find a way to clean this up before the shoot tomorrow.

Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I'll manage.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I'm afraid I have to agree.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I'm back.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I'm going to be awhile.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I'm going to start with a facial, And then get my hooves done.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I'm in the zone, as t'were.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I'm just glad that i have all of you to remind me that Even if i accidentally use magical remover potion On my mane.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I'm not sure he made the trip down with us, dear.

Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I'm right behind you!
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I'm saying your brother will win.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I'm so sorry.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I'm sorry fluttershy, but i believe applejack has made better argument.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I'm sorry. could you please ask her to turn it down!?
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I'm sure she can mix a fix for both of us.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I'm thinking noir esque minimalist, but with a twist.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I've been working on it ever since i was given the assignment.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I've come prepared!
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I've gotten much better at, roughing it, haven't i?

Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I, owe you an apology too. buckball may not be my thing, but it's something you enjoy.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_I-i just came by To see if you had any books on historical fashion.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_If everypony could speak in a whisper for the next few days, That would be delightful.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_If i may.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_If somepony doesn't like you for who you are, it's their loss.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_If they're in fashion right now Then they're practically already out.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_If you are not willing to put forth the effort Required to pull a prank that everypony can enjoy.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_If you look closely, you can see flecks of gold in them.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_In fact, i think i know just how you feel.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_In fact, you didn't change at all.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_In the middle of my friendship quilting class?
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_Indeed. You have all the inner strength you need, But i think we prefer it coming From our sweet, regular fluttershy.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_Is everything ok?
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_Is pick flowers that accentuate my mane.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_Is there something wrong with your face?
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_Is this the same recipe you used For your spring has sprung party?

Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_Isn't it called manehattan escapes Because it's a deluxe spa, Where you can escape all of your troubles?
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_It had to be done or the tree of harmony wouldn't have survived.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_It is called, calligraphy, darling.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_It makes for a captivating color story When you present them to whomever they're intended.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_It may indeed, be a, problem.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_It sounds like you need a map. Luckily, we have just the thing.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_It took forever, but it was worth it.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_It turns out, pinkie may not have taken our critique Of her yovidaphone playing In the spirit with which it was intended.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_It was a really good try darling.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_It was a valiant effort, but You should refuse to give him Your business and just walk away.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_It wasn't me. i swear!
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_It will be something your brother expects, And he'll always win.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_It would be an honor.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_It'll be fine, pinkie.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_It's a good idea applejack, but photo finish is looking For the most beautiful manes, not bonnets.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_It's clear we've all had our moments to shine, twilight.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_It's fine, my dear.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_It's just a little rough around the edges.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_It's just that i absolutely must have a model for my phoenix feather dress, and nopony else is available.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_It's quite all right.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_It's sure to draw in the hoof traffic?
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_It's time for us to consider our futures In this new, trixie-led ponyville.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_It's, stretchy but not clingy.

Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_Just admit it, you're as guilty of framing rainbow dash As you are of ruining that ivory scarf!
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_Just another innocent casualty of that disastrous boat trip.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_Just because i'd needed twilight To perform the butterfly wing spell on me Whenever i wanted to deliver merchandise.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_Just give him a chance, rarity.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_Just like a true professional.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_Just look at these costumes. surely something resonates with your inner wonderbolt.

Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_My apologies.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_My ears are a little bit clogged, or something.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_My eyes need a rest From all this icky muck.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_My friend rainbow dash talks about her all the time. She says what fleet foot lacks in size, She makes up for in speed.
Rarity_Neutral_Noisy_My mane will be flowing over the chaise in the tableau I have in mind, but i was hoping to choose the color.

Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_I just had to make this little bow for you.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_I just have a few questions for you.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_I just told you darling.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_I knew it! but twilight refused to admit it.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_I knew this had to do with my love of fashion.

Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_I require your help in, borrowing one or two, To bring back to the boutique where i can restore them.

Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_I simply cannot let such a crime against fabulosity Go uncorrected.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_I smelled something on the envelope.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_I spent hours by the lily pond on the castle grounds, Which inspired this gown, water filly!
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_I still feel it needs a certain je ne sais quoi.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_I suppose it didn't. still, a disaster was averted!
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_I suppose it's worth a try.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_I suppose your vision would be somewhat obscured.

Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_I think it's divine.

Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_I wanted to tell you about the important lesson i learned During my visit.

Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm not saying you did but if, you took a break.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm saying this with love, but, have you looked in a mirror lately?
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm so glad you showed that to me, darling.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm so honored that cosmare was able to do A piece on the grand opening of my boutique!
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm sorry, i just don't think it's going to be possible.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm sure any negative behavior she might be displaying Is simply the result of nerves.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm sure she could have used her magic To transform this park in an instant!
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm sure they're just taking the necessary precautions.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm thinking, pastel silk here and here,.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm trying to think of a nicer way to say, big bummer.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_I've got a feeling ruffled taffeta capes Are going to make a huge comeback this season, And i want to be ahead of the game.

Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_If the wind came from one direction, It would really intensify the effect.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_If there's anything else you can remember, dish.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_If twilight had used her magic to fix the park, It wouldn't have fixed the real problem,.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_In order to solve the mystery, we had to be focused.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_In the very heart of this glorious metropolis!
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_Indeed.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_Indeed.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_Indicating that somepony had been hiding behind them!

Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_Is it to hide, the chocolate stain!?
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_Is that the customer who ordered this princess dress?

Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_Sometimes, it's about accepting each others' differences.

Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_That hat clashes with your mane, Not to mention it's far too large And will undoubtedly obstruct your vision.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_That is what makes manehattan so splendid and amazing.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_That while there are ponies that will take advantage of your generosity.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_That's fine, darling.

Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_Then when we were examining spitfire's room.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_Then, in the castle hallway.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_There i was, surveying the crime scene.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_There!
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_There's a guest performance by a local theater troupe, the method mares.

Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_They were at their post at the entrance to the hallway all night.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_They were clearly cut with shears, which means somepony planted it!
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_They're different, that's all.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_This evening is sure to be a disaster.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_This event promises to bring our broken neighbors together And restore our sense of community But there's so much to do and we need your help.

Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_We are most grateful for your invitation.

Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_Where our quaint little hummock began.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_While i've always prided myself on paying attention to detail.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_Who was the lucky pony?
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_Whoever ordered the cake got a chocolate stain on her ivory scarf.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_Why don't we start heading.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_Why shouldn't she expect the very best on her wedding day?
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_Why, of course it is.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_Why? because it was somepony famous?
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_Wind rider!
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_With crinoline underneath.

Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_You don't say!
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_You groom her with her silken brush, head to toe and don't forget to pooch her pillow out in the middle, That's where she likes it.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_You just dip cloth.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_You just need ponies in here to give it a chance.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_You know how much we appreciate all you do for us.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_You more than deserved it.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_You see dear?
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_You see fluttershy, the beauty of nightmare night Is that you don't have to dress up as something scary.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_You wanted me to make a dress Exactly like the one in the book.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_You went to get spitfire, Even though it meant you couldn't fly today.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_You will join the group making the pony tones quartet, the pony tones quintet!
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_You're right, applejack. the search continues.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_You're right, spike.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_You're right. too little.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_You've got to try.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_Your fabulous manicure.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_Your party sounds simply divine.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_Zesty, are you sure you wouldn't like to try the food?
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_a much bigger dress.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_a steam is just the start. i know exactly what we'll do and an hour will be simply perfect.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_after the day we've had, i'm probably looking forward to the swap part of the pie sister surprise swap day even more than the two of you!
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_ah, yes. very nice.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_all made From a fabulous new fabric i've been developing for months.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_although he can be pushy at times.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_and now just a little er, twenty yards more.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_and the inspiration just struck me for the perfect shot! be a dear and go, stand behind it.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_and then you fire off your party cannon.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_and while it's lovely how excited you are, there's absolutely no chance of me getting swept into the.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_baby unicorns get strange Magic surges that come and go.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_behind the scenes access, Until now!
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_but somehow this ragtag group of ne'er do wells.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_came together, and created the perfect boutique.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_cinnamon chai's tea and cake shop!
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_clearly pinkie pie had caught applejack's sea madness.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_darling, i have been trying for moons, but applejack is so busy these days, it's next to impossible.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_darlings we'll all need a complete wardrobe update.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_despite applejack's colorful seafarer attitude.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_er Then again, perhaps i should keep it but a scootch longer.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_good heavens that's a lot of empty pie plates.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_good, So thanks for your help and, good luck to you.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_hm. maybe it isn't so hard to get stuck doing extra work after all.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_hmmm it sounds lovely applejack but, unfortunately, you spent so much time fixing the steam room we don't have any time left to use it.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_i am sorry, but my mane wasn't made To support marine life.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_i don't suppose those pies are the last chore on the schedule for today?
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_i have finished the dress.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_i need to scour the city for the most perfect location for my new shop.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_i was still determined to get my friends out of their element, by providing them with all the refinements of a luxury cruise.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_i'd made sure to bring the most delectable nibbles for them to enjoy.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_i'll just have to help you find a new present for maud.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_is that?
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_it looks like we've got everything on snowfall's list.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_little more.

Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_many a pony has tried their hoof at joining the ranks Of the elite fashion trend setters.

Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_morning twilight, spike.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_my clothes arrive soon, My sales associate after that, and with a little, dusting.

Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_right here.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_say, where is your cannon?
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_she made a huge sacrifice to bring that smile back to her friends' and families' faces.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_since my boutique in canterlot has been doing so nicely, it only makes sense for me to open one there as well.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_so, not only can we not take part in a fabulous ancient ceremony.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_some might say, it's the ultimate achievement In equestrian fashion, and never before has a reporter Been granted such unfettered.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_surely there must be something here that catches your eye.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_that is impressive.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_the height of sophistication, elegance, culture.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_the laundry room, of course.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_there are some things i must attend to.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_there's only one way to find out.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_this water is hardly sparkling, But i suppose it will have to do.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_um, are you certain everything you just did is entirely necessary to feed the pigs?
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_well yes, I'll come to canterlot with new designs And to see the customers of course.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_well, i'm in.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_well, if anypony can exactly remember something she read for the first time two minutes ago, it's you twilight.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_well, it may be practical.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_well, the solution is obvious.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_well. maybe not too far away.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_what do you think about this?
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_when the perfect chance comes along, you do something he can't expect.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_wonderful, now that we've solved the great steam mystery, we can finally get back to our.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_yes yes, manehattan.
Rarity_Neutral_Very Noisy_you really can see everything from here.
Rarity_Neutral__A bit higher darling, please.

Rarity_Neutral__A lot of their customs are a, bit murky.
Rarity_Neutral__A problem is all it would be.
Rarity_Neutral__Absolutely. we'll start with the slow dance.
Rarity_Neutral__Actually, we are the pony tones minus one tone.
Rarity_Neutral__After all, sapphire shores is the pony of pop.
Rarity_Neutral__After you.
Rarity_Neutral__Ah ah, what did i say about using our real names?
Rarity_Neutral__All of these things were sweetie belle's idea.
Rarity_Neutral__All of your sister's things are gone explain.
Rarity_Neutral__All right.
Rarity_Neutral__All right. even if our friend the bunyip is responsible For sinking the boat.
Rarity_Neutral__All the evidence points to him.
Rarity_Neutral__Allow us to treat you to dinner.
Rarity_Neutral__An entire wagon and no anti friz?
Rarity_Neutral__And be there for your friends.
Rarity_Neutral__And coming from me, that is saying a lot.
Rarity_Neutral__And everypony hangs on her every word When it comes to cuisine.
Rarity_Neutral__And for all her babbling, pinkie pie was right about one thing.
Rarity_Neutral__And her equestria wide tour launches in canterlot next week.
Rarity_Neutral__And how did you meet Miss jubilee?
Rarity_Neutral__And how we've continued to face every problem and threat to Equestria over the years.
Rarity_Neutral__And i am just the pony to help.
Rarity_Neutral__And i have plenty of sewing machine cake left over.
Rarity_Neutral__And i'll start on the Eternal elegance empire silhouette evening gown.
Rarity_Neutral__And it was perfect.
Rarity_Neutral__And now it's time to vote.
Rarity_Neutral__And now twilight, if you and fluttershy wouldn't mind helping with the fashion show?
Rarity_Neutral__And of course, we do understand that your royal duties must come first.
Rarity_Neutral__And one in canterlot.
Rarity_Neutral__And the ponyville spa is still open, anyone?
Rarity_Neutral__And then you and i are going to have a serious talk.
Rarity_Neutral__And we simply adore having you around, but We worry you might be, ahem, avoiding something else?
Rarity_Neutral__And where's your wagon?
Rarity_Neutral__And you are?
Rarity_Neutral__And you're allowed to feel a little jealous about it.
Rarity_Neutral__And you're sure this is where Pinkie told us to get the blackberries for her special coronation dessert?
Rarity_Neutral__And you, love it.
Rarity_Neutral__And, of course i would say.
Rarity_Neutral__Anger is no excuse for poor manners after all.
Rarity_Neutral__Another map adventure perhaps?
Rarity_Neutral__Another visit to the castle of the two sisters, i presume?
Rarity_Neutral__Any chance i can catch an encore performance?
Rarity_Neutral__Anything in that wagon for mane maintenance?
Rarity_Neutral__Applejack and i were specifically summoned here to be of service.
Rarity_Neutral__Applejack saved spike's life and now he has to serve her forever.

Rarity_Neutral__Are too.
Rarity_Neutral__Are too.
Rarity_Neutral__Are too.
Rarity_Neutral__Are we getting warmer?
Rarity_Neutral__Are we sure they're open?
Rarity_Neutral__Are you honestly going to stand there and tell us You know nothing about all the pranking rainbow dash Has been doing?
Rarity_Neutral__Are you supposed to pack warm?
Rarity_Neutral__Aren't you going to tell me to change something too?
Rarity_Neutral__Ask any pony, they'll tell you.
Rarity_Neutral__At least some pony here has good manners.
Rarity_Neutral__Attention everypony.
Rarity_Neutral__Barely.
Rarity_Neutral__Because, my plan, is for each of us to devise our own unexpected part of it.
Rarity_Neutral__Beg pardon?
Rarity_Neutral__Besides, it will grow back.
Rarity_Neutral__Best of seventy one?
Rarity_Neutral__Big mac is inconveniently late.
Rarity_Neutral__Big mac, can you please start the song?
Rarity_Neutral__But i really was looking forward to a spa day.
Rarity_Neutral__But i'm with applejack.
Rarity_Neutral__But i've never had the opportunity to attend.
Rarity_Neutral__But just be patient. we'll get you your favorite Balloon bouquet, and it'll all be worth it.
Rarity_Neutral__But now i see just how special it is. au naturel.
Rarity_Neutral__But now it's just the essentials for me.
Rarity_Neutral__But now that we'll be living in different places, I'm not exactly sure how.
Rarity_Neutral__But of course darling.
Rarity_Neutral__But of course that's the easy part.
Rarity_Neutral__But perhaps you already know what's causing all of this calamity.
Rarity_Neutral__But ponyville was always going to be my home base.
Rarity_Neutral__But the fetlock fete, Or whatever twilight is calling it.
Rarity_Neutral__But the scares at nightmare night Are of an entirely different nature.
Rarity_Neutral__But this time, we guarantee it shall be different.
Rarity_Neutral__But trend obviously has a thing for farm life.
Rarity_Neutral__But we should leave now.
Rarity_Neutral__But why, darling? you went back to apologize, they accepted.
Rarity_Neutral__But, that's a dented old pie tin.
Rarity_Neutral__Ceremonial, headdress?
Rarity_Neutral__Change does that.
Rarity_Neutral__Come on!
Rarity_Neutral__Could somepony have sent spitfire a fake note?
Rarity_Neutral__Could we spend it together?
Rarity_Neutral__Could you ask her to turn it down please!?
Rarity_Neutral__Darling, change is an integral part of fashion.
Rarity_Neutral__Darling, you're not even prepared.
Rarity_Neutral__Dear princess celestia.
Rarity_Neutral__Didn't you see how nervous she was?

Rarity_Neutral__Hm, or, not.
Rarity_Neutral__Hmm, i suppose it is a little cluttered.
Rarity_Neutral__Hmm.
Rarity_Neutral__Hmm.

Rarity_Neutral__Honestly, you ponies have no sense of humor.
Rarity_Neutral__How can i have forgotten?
Rarity_Neutral__How many other ponies are coming?
Rarity_Neutral__How would you like to work for my friend making all the costumes for his next show?

Rarity_Neutral__I am designer and couturier rarity,.
Rarity_Neutral__I am drawn to the beauty and drama of fashion.
Rarity_Neutral__I am rarity, and i have been chosen as pony of ceremonies for the ponyville days festival.
Rarity_Neutral__I appreciate that, applejack.
Rarity_Neutral__I call it the fountain of truth.
Rarity_Neutral__I can't believe i ever thought i could impress her.
Rarity_Neutral__I can't believe you've never told us that story before.
Rarity_Neutral__I can't imagine cancelling such a beautiful And important ceremony, over something so potentially adorable!
Rarity_Neutral__I can't wait to hear all about the.
Rarity_Neutral__I completely understand.
Rarity_Neutral__I couldn't ask you to do that.
Rarity_Neutral__I design ensembles for the gala every year.
Rarity_Neutral__I did exactly what i would do if this were my home!
Rarity_Neutral__I do understand your hesitation.
Rarity_Neutral__I don't know how i'm going to finish this.
Rarity_Neutral__I don't think fluttershy would have called us all here To talk about this, if she thought it was funny.
Rarity_Neutral__I don't understand. When i left fluttershy, she had everything well in hoof.
Rarity_Neutral__I guess technically, i'd have to move away To live in exile.
Rarity_Neutral__I had planned to transform it into an elegant country inn for the festival.
Rarity_Neutral__I have just what you need.
Rarity_Neutral__I have put on enough fashion shows to recognize stage fright when I see it.
Rarity_Neutral__I hired her right on the spot!
Rarity_Neutral__I insist on making you a new dress.
Rarity_Neutral__I just assisted with the execution.
Rarity_Neutral__I just don't understand how you're able to do it.
Rarity_Neutral__I just have two other boutiques.
Rarity_Neutral__I knew applejack and pinkie pie wanted to get out Of their element.
Rarity_Neutral__I knew i needed a manager for canterlot carousel.
Rarity_Neutral__I know how you feel.
Rarity_Neutral__I know what i need to do!
Rarity_Neutral__I know what you're thinking, but i promise.
Rarity_Neutral__I know you must be bored, darling.
Rarity_Neutral__I know, you're speechless.
Rarity_Neutral__I might have a few ideas.
Rarity_Neutral__I might not have.
Rarity_Neutral__I myself am considering opening boutiques for non ponies.
Rarity_Neutral__I never would have invited dandy to help If i thought he'd act in such a manner.
Rarity_Neutral__I only brought the essentials.
Rarity_Neutral__I promise never to keep my feelings a secret again.
Rarity_Neutral__I promised to deliver a new design to Fancy Pants for his Monocle and Top Hat Appreciation Society soiree.
Rarity_Neutral__I realize that makes me sound like an old mare.
Rarity_Neutral__I really must get back to the shop and clean up.
Rarity_Neutral__I suppose you'll need a job now that you're no longer with suri.
Rarity_Neutral__I suppose, it gave us something else to focus on.
Rarity_Neutral__I take your hint, but Rarity is above such nonsense.
Rarity_Neutral__I think i've left my measuring tape under the fabric over there.
Rarity_Neutral__I think it sounds delightful.
Rarity_Neutral__I think, i have an idea.
Rarity_Neutral__I thought maybe your shampoo had triggered early onset Mare pattern baldness.
Rarity_Neutral__I thought she was still making costumes.
Rarity_Neutral__I told you your perspective would be beneficial.
Rarity_Neutral__I uh, have a little bit of time Before i have to head back to canterlot.
Rarity_Neutral__I was just struck with a sudden inspiration to change my design for your gown.
Rarity_Neutral__I was nothing but confident.
Rarity_Neutral__I will go out and bring the crowd.
Rarity_Neutral__I won't take no for an answer.
Rarity_Neutral__I would be eternally grateful.
Rarity_Neutral__I'll have just enough time on the train to weave the star spider sash for your gown.
Rarity_Neutral__I'll redo them!
Rarity_Neutral__I'm a simple filly.
Rarity_Neutral__I'm desperate to find one.
Rarity_Neutral__I'm going to ignore that comment out of my desire to help you.
Rarity_Neutral__I'm going to make sure she doesn't break a hoof out there.
Rarity_Neutral__I'm not gonna stop now!
Rarity_Neutral__I'm number four, and I need just one more itsy-bitsy minute. Be a dear and have somepony go ahead of me, hmm?
Rarity_Neutral__I'm sorry darlings, but I can't possibly go to Appleloosa.
Rarity_Neutral__I'm sorry, fluttershy, but i have no remedy for this situation.
Rarity_Neutral__I'm taking the students to the lake.
Rarity_Neutral__I've made my creative contribution as i'd hoped to do.
Rarity_Neutral__I've never seen anything quite so stunning before.
Rarity_Neutral__If i know rainbow dash, she'll come through.
Rarity_Neutral__If she's coming tonight, there is quite a bit of work That needs to get done.
Rarity_Neutral__If the mayor wasn't so desperate for our assistance, we'd most certainly stay here in canterlot.
Rarity_Neutral__If there's one thing i learned at friendship university, It is not to give up when you know what's right.
Rarity_Neutral__If you can handle these problems, I'll focus on the designs for the front window display.
Rarity_Neutral__If you don't like it, you should just tell me.
Rarity_Neutral__If you think flim and flam are up to no good, You can't give up.
Rarity_Neutral__In that case, at an elegant affair like a pony dance.
Rarity_Neutral__In these disguises, We could pass as students at out own school.
Rarity_Neutral__Interesting choice.
Rarity_Neutral__Is that princess celestia!
Rarity_Neutral__Is there something i can help you with?
Rarity_Neutral__Isn't that right, rainbow dash?
Rarity_Neutral__It all started at the docks.
Rarity_Neutral__It doesn't feel right to us either, darling.
Rarity_Neutral__It must be gratifying to have your idol writing to you About the friendship lessons he's learning.
Rarity_Neutral__It took a teensy bit longer than we thought.
Rarity_Neutral__It was inspired by the fountain in the canterlot castle garden.
Rarity_Neutral__It was one thing to lose as a filly, But can you imagine if i didn't win the most creative now?
Rarity_Neutral__It will take rearranging all the music, and we just don't have time.
Rarity_Neutral__It's not like fluttershy to disappear like this.
Rarity_Neutral__It's not so bad.
Rarity_Neutral__It's nothing to be embarrassed by.
Rarity_Neutral__It's the first shift in royal power in over a millenium.
Rarity_Neutral__It's tradition.
Rarity_Neutral__It's what we always do, darling.
Rarity_Neutral__It's your birthiversary!
Rarity_Neutral__Just a moment.
Rarity_Neutral__Just because one has the ability to perform lots of magic does not make one better than the rest of us.
Rarity_Neutral__Just don't get the shampoo.
Rarity_Neutral__Just look at those dreadful bellbottoms. what were ponies thinking?
Rarity_Neutral__Let me guess, applejack.
Rarity_Neutral__Let us never speak of this again.
Rarity_Neutral__Like it?
Rarity_Neutral__Like it?
Rarity_Neutral__Lose the apple farm? well we can't let that happen, now can we?
Rarity_Neutral__Made them myself. and of course you'll all want cake. won't you?
Rarity_Neutral__Maybe he moved out.
Rarity_Neutral__Mayor.
Rarity_Neutral__Me neither.
Rarity_Neutral__Me too, and i was there.
Rarity_Neutral__Messy?
Rarity_Neutral__Mm hm, as you well know, the real focus at rarity for you Is on the customer.
Rarity_Neutral__Mmm hmm.
Rarity_Neutral__Much better.
Rarity_Neutral__My ponyville friends Will appreciate my hard work more than anypony.
Rarity_Neutral__My work here in ponyville is nearly complete.
Rarity_Neutral__My, my, my. What boasting.
Rarity_Neutral__Never fear, my dear.
Rarity_Neutral__Never heard of it, but i have a much better one.
Rarity_Neutral__Never.
Rarity_Neutral__No moseying.
Rarity_Neutral__No!
Rarity_Neutral__No. i don't like it.
Rarity_Neutral__Nopony indeed.
Rarity_Neutral__Nopony is going to have your elegance and poise.
Rarity_Neutral__Nopony will ever miss it!
Rarity_Neutral__Nopony.
Rarity_Neutral__Nor am i!
Rarity_Neutral__Not a problem.
Rarity_Neutral__Not everything can be solved with brute force.
Rarity_Neutral__Not plainity, but.
Rarity_Neutral__Not to worry.
Rarity_Neutral__Nothing could keep pinkie pie from missing this.
Rarity_Neutral__Now it's perfect.
Rarity_Neutral__Now um, how can i help.
Rarity_Neutral__Now, pony tones, i want you all to rest your voices for the remainder of the day.
Rarity_Neutral__Now, where are the other guests?
Rarity_Neutral__Of course everypony is a little jumpy.
Rarity_Neutral__Of course i knew.
Rarity_Neutral__Of course it's quiet.
Rarity_Neutral__Of course you will have to look after More than just one flower now.
Rarity_Neutral__Of course!
Rarity_Neutral__Of course, darling.
Rarity_Neutral__Of course, finishing twilight's dress In time for her birthday party is still my top priority.
Rarity_Neutral__Of course.
Rarity_Neutral__Of course.
Rarity_Neutral__Of course.
Rarity_Neutral__Oh a tweak here, a tuck there.
Rarity_Neutral__Oh but you must, fluttershy.
Rarity_Neutral__Oh calm down, rainbow dash.
Rarity_Neutral__Oh darling, i need a dozen lavender pieces For photo finish's shoot On the most beautiful manes in equestria.
Rarity_Neutral__Oh don't panic.
Rarity_Neutral__Oh don't worry fluttershy.
Rarity_Neutral__Oh good, i'd hate for her to ruin everything.
Rarity_Neutral__Oh i'm much more sorry than you are.
Rarity_Neutral__Oh it's gonna take me forever to do all of that packing.
Rarity_Neutral__Oh my, what a terrible dream i had. or, maybe i'm still having it.
Rarity_Neutral__Oh no i'm sure i was much worse.
Rarity_Neutral__Oh nonononono, you don't understand, applejack!
Rarity_Neutral__Oh well, and how does muddying my hooves serve any useful purpose?
Rarity_Neutral__Oh why thank you most sincerely.
Rarity_Neutral__Oh yes.
Rarity_Neutral__Oh!
Rarity_Neutral__Oh!
Rarity_Neutral__Oh! as soon as she sees these fabulous costumes.
Rarity_Neutral__Oh! me oh i'm fine, thank you.
Rarity_Neutral__Oh! there is certainly no call for that.
Rarity_Neutral__Oh, and I took a bite of the cake.
Rarity_Neutral__Oh, and when i'm done.
Rarity_Neutral__Oh, did i say that out loud?
Rarity_Neutral__Oh, don't be silly, of course i would!
Rarity_Neutral__Oh, don't be so modest.
Rarity_Neutral__Oh, i don't think she meant to.
Rarity_Neutral__Oh, i'd love to help, But i have to meet rainbow dash for our day of fun together.
Rarity_Neutral__Oh, never. i knew you'd be perfect.
Rarity_Neutral__Oh, pfft, they're not old, darling.
Rarity_Neutral__Oh, precious pants.
Rarity_Neutral__Oh, rainbow dash, if you want all those cookies, You will have to buy them, just like everypony else.
Rarity_Neutral__Oh, that's just awful.
Rarity_Neutral__Oh, you won't be traveling alone darling.
Rarity_Neutral__Oh, you're just saying that.
Rarity_Neutral__Oh.
Rarity_Neutral__Oh? why not?
Rarity_Neutral__Okay. i did exactly what each of you asked for.
Rarity_Neutral__Old rarity agrees.
Rarity_Neutral__One in my home town of ponyville.
Rarity_Neutral__Only one more pre coronation stop.
Rarity_Neutral__Onward!
Rarity_Neutral__Ooh, power posing works wonders Whenever i feel intimidated.
Rarity_Neutral__Ooh, you're spitfire's mum?
Rarity_Neutral__Or if they'd even enjoy it?
Rarity_Neutral__Ow!
Rarity_Neutral__Perfect! we'll go shopping first.
Rarity_Neutral__Perhaps its needs.
Rarity_Neutral__Perhaps we can stay out here in the foyer?
Rarity_Neutral__Perhaps you should pay zecora a visit sooner rather than later.
Rarity_Neutral__Photo finish wants to make you a star.
Rarity_Neutral__Pinkie! we are the perfect team for this.
Rarity_Neutral__Please!
Rarity_Neutral__Ponies can't talk while they're eating Those fabulous cookies.
Rarity_Neutral__Precisely why i questioned the castle guards!
Rarity_Neutral__Princess cadance and shining armor's baby is due any day.
Rarity_Neutral__Princess celestia.
Rarity_Neutral__Promises were made, and, and i shall sew my very best To provide each and every pony a princess dress full of tlc.
Rarity_Neutral__Rainbow dash and pinkie pie, you come with me! we're going shopping!
Rarity_Neutral__Relatively speaking.
Rarity_Neutral__Remember my costume designer friend who got me the tickets?
Rarity_Neutral__Right after she's done with her conversation.
Rarity_Neutral__See?
Rarity_Neutral__Seeing as we've been working so hard and everything.
Rarity_Neutral__Sequins.
Rarity_Neutral__She didn't see you at the sweet shop, did she?
Rarity_Neutral__She judges a restaurant on cuisine, décor And presentation.
Rarity_Neutral__She started it.
Rarity_Neutral__She's just a harmless schoolpony engaged in a little idle gossip.
Rarity_Neutral__She's resting on the bed.
Rarity_Neutral__She's, sorry.
Rarity_Neutral__Short tails are in this season.
Rarity_Neutral__Silly. this is called a mud mask.
Rarity_Neutral__Simply the most important reason i've ever had in my entire life!
Rarity_Neutral__So i vote for her.
Rarity_Neutral__So what do you do now, dashie?
Rarity_Neutral__So when sassy showed me her resume and i saw that she worked In all of the finest boutiques in canterlot.
Rarity_Neutral__So, that's a.
Rarity_Neutral__So, we'd be allowed to teach however we want to?
Rarity_Neutral__So.
Rarity_Neutral__Somepony has to.
Rarity_Neutral__Something's strange about the sky.
Rarity_Neutral__Sorry I'm late, I just had to finish Applejack's going away present for her debut at the rodeo.
Rarity_Neutral__Sounds like a perfect drama free way to spend the day with cadance.
Rarity_Neutral__Starlight, darling.
Rarity_Neutral__Strong smelling raccoons for me?
Rarity_Neutral__Sure. come on down.
Rarity_Neutral__Sweetie belle, precious face.
Rarity_Neutral__Talk about getting your beauty sleep.
Rarity_Neutral__Thank you, applejack.
Rarity_Neutral__Thank you, spike but this is an ensemble.
Rarity_Neutral__Thanks, twilight.
Rarity_Neutral__That does look uncomfortable.
Rarity_Neutral__That is definitely the one. Photo Finish is going to love it.
Rarity_Neutral__That means a lot.
Rarity_Neutral__That one, of course.
Rarity_Neutral__That tapestry is far too heavy. we'll just have to find a smaller one.
Rarity_Neutral__That's just it darling.
Rarity_Neutral__That's why i wanted a friend to do it.
Rarity_Neutral__That's why, the winner of the contest Will get to debut their line in the carousel boutique.
Rarity_Neutral__That. was.
Rarity_Neutral__The absolute best place for fine dining In all of equestria.
Rarity_Neutral__The fate of equestria has hung in the balance during most of your visits with her.
Rarity_Neutral__The more i sold the more each dress lost its time, Love, and couture.
Rarity_Neutral__The only time she can make herself available is, tonight.
Rarity_Neutral__The party is this afternoon?
Rarity_Neutral__The pony cotillion. that's fluttershy's specialty.
Rarity_Neutral__The three hoof rating.
Rarity_Neutral__The warrior of inner strength.
Rarity_Neutral__Then what?
Rarity_Neutral__Then you must let us help you stop it before that happens!
Rarity_Neutral__There are more over here.
Rarity_Neutral__There is plenty for everypony.
Rarity_Neutral__There's no time to dawdle if you want the coronation to be perfect.
Rarity_Neutral__These fabrics all need to be dyed those colors.
Rarity_Neutral__These vampire fruit bats sound downright dreadful!
Rarity_Neutral__They glow for a short while after they're spun.
Rarity_Neutral__They simply work for us.
Rarity_Neutral__They were only a first pass.
Rarity_Neutral__They were right here.
Rarity_Neutral__They would never guess, that i was just a simple pony from little old ponyville.
Rarity_Neutral__They'll be along.
Rarity_Neutral__They're probably all in a cookie coma right now.
Rarity_Neutral__Things must evolve, or they become stale.
Rarity_Neutral__This is a very long line for one of twisty pop's balloons.
Rarity_Neutral__This is the first place trophy for fashion week.
Rarity_Neutral__This is the opportunity of a lifetime.
Rarity_Neutral__This is why a girl always packs extra accessories.
Rarity_Neutral__Three weeks.
Rarity_Neutral__To reduce the puffiness around one's eyes, of course.
Rarity_Neutral__Too frilly too, shiny.
Rarity_Neutral__Too green, too yellow.
Rarity_Neutral__Too poofy, not poofy enough.
Rarity_Neutral__Twilight is a very capable pony.
Rarity_Neutral__Twilight sparkle.
Rarity_Neutral__Twilight!
Rarity_Neutral__Uh, I do believe I have another engagement scheduled for this evening that.
Rarity_Neutral__Uh, how can i say this tactfully.
Rarity_Neutral__Uh, oh.
Rarity_Neutral__Uh, still, when i decided to open this one.
Rarity_Neutral__Uh, would you boys mind pulling our carriage to the gala?
Rarity_Neutral__Uh, yes, well uh, maybe you could manage it 'til, sunset ish?
Rarity_Neutral__Very well.
Rarity_Neutral__Very.
Rarity_Neutral__Was it really that bad?
Rarity_Neutral__We certainly had a good time.
Rarity_Neutral__We don't. if dash thinks i'm going to fall For whatever she's got in mind.
Rarity_Neutral__We have absolute confidence in your abilities, pinkie pie.
Rarity_Neutral__We have everything covered.
Rarity_Neutral__We know what it means.
Rarity_Neutral__We need to think like our students.
Rarity_Neutral__We sure are, completely new.
Rarity_Neutral__We want that fluttershy back.
Rarity_Neutral__We were hoping that being able to look at your beautiful Old memories, would inspire you to make new ones.
Rarity_Neutral__We were just doing the wrong jobs.
Rarity_Neutral__We'll do a final run through tomorrow before the big event. alright?
Rarity_Neutral__We'll get to the bottom of this.
Rarity_Neutral__We'll just have to see.
Rarity_Neutral__We're picking up the final touch for your apres hors d'oevres gown.
Rarity_Neutral__We've been planning this party for such a long time.
Rarity_Neutral__We've got to find a way to be there for her.
Rarity_Neutral__We've tried every kind of studying.
Rarity_Neutral__We, artistes require certain necessities, In order to do our best work.
Rarity_Neutral__Well I could. But, you'll learn as you get older how important it is to keep your promises.
Rarity_Neutral__Well of course you.
Rarity_Neutral__Well so did the princess dress.
Rarity_Neutral__Well the headdress is too big for you, and cape had too much sparkle.
Rarity_Neutral__Well then, how about a hat from the, ahem.
Rarity_Neutral__Well we can't perform tonight with only three voices.
Rarity_Neutral__Well, except for the start line.
Rarity_Neutral__Well, hold on, because it gets even worse.
Rarity_Neutral__Well, i have no trouble saying it.
Rarity_Neutral__Well, i offered to make all the costumes for his next show!
Rarity_Neutral__Well, i think it's a terrible waste of an exquisite talent.
Rarity_Neutral__Well, maybe it wasn't the middle of the ocean.
Rarity_Neutral__Well, maybe she wouldn't have been if somepony else hadn't been so sloppy.
Rarity_Neutral__Well, since you dragged it out of me.
Rarity_Neutral__Well, spitfire got a note from you saying you weren't feeling well and.
Rarity_Neutral__Well, that will never do.
Rarity_Neutral__Well, they've certainly made A difference in the way you Carry yourself.
Rarity_Neutral__Well, this being a thread shop, I thought I might, buy some?
Rarity_Neutral__Well, this is a team effort.
Rarity_Neutral__What are you supposed to pack when you go into exile?
Rarity_Neutral__What do you think?
Rarity_Neutral__What if i just spruce up your, uh.
Rarity_Neutral__What if you sang not in front of everypony?
Rarity_Neutral__What is life if you can't make it beautiful?
Rarity_Neutral__What matters is what you think, spike.
Rarity_Neutral__What say, we go our separate ways before one of us says something she will regret.
Rarity_Neutral__What would a grown pony like you want to do?
Rarity_Neutral__What's that? you want to help me more?
Rarity_Neutral__What, this old thing?
Rarity_Neutral__What?
Rarity_Neutral__What? oh yes, yes. that of course too.
Rarity_Neutral__Whatever you want me to have in my mind, starlight glimmer.
Rarity_Neutral__When it comes to food, she is the ultimate authority In canterlot and thus all equestria.
Rarity_Neutral__Which means i have quite a few lavender arrangements to spare.
Rarity_Neutral__Which reminds me, can you get a message to spike?
Rarity_Neutral__While you go to the ponyville spa For some much needed rest and relaxation.
Rarity_Neutral__Who cares what some stuffy unicorn Thinks of the food here. it's exquisite.
Rarity_Neutral__Who flies through the air all over the world to hide magic, sparkly eggs?
Rarity_Neutral__Why do you protest so? you've already given up wearing your crown all the time.
Rarity_Neutral__Why don't i stay behind with coriander To get the restaurant ready for zesty's arrival.
Rarity_Neutral__Why don't you see if Rainbow Dash is free?
Rarity_Neutral__Why in the wide-wide world of equestria Would princess celestia bring along someone like that?
Rarity_Neutral__Why, if sweetie belle hadn't.
Rarity_Neutral__Why, thank you so much.
Rarity_Neutral__Why, zesty gourmand, the queen of cuisine.
Rarity_Neutral__With me!
Rarity_Neutral__With thread this exquisite, can you blame them?
Rarity_Neutral__Would it be ok if fluttershy sang for you one last time?
Rarity_Neutral__Would you be a dear and fetch me some vermillion satin From the back?
Rarity_Neutral__Would you like to try your hoof at a nest?
Rarity_Neutral__Yes i am.
Rarity_Neutral__Yes! you're taking twilight to the spa!
Rarity_Neutral__Yes, i used to overpack a tad.
Rarity_Neutral__Yes, it will keep me away from ponyville for a while.
Rarity_Neutral__Yes, scootaloo, that's exactly.
Rarity_Neutral__Yes, that what we said, darling.
Rarity_Neutral__Yes, well.
Rarity_Neutral__Yes.
Rarity_Neutral__Yes. Yes, i do know them.
Rarity_Neutral__You already said that darling.
Rarity_Neutral__You and fluttershy stay here.
Rarity_Neutral__You and saffron can try and drum up some business.
Rarity_Neutral__You can start, by letting us do it for you.
Rarity_Neutral__You can't let a few fashion ponies undo all that progress.
Rarity_Neutral__You could pay zecora a visit.
Rarity_Neutral__You didn't expect me to lay on the grass, did you?
Rarity_Neutral__You do?
Rarity_Neutral__You don't happen to have a fainting couch in here, do you?
Rarity_Neutral__You don't mind, do you, spike?
Rarity_Neutral__You don't want a new gown, either.
Rarity_Neutral__You finish up your work, and by this time tomorrow You'll be up to your mane in ponies who want to lend a hoof.
Rarity_Neutral__You got what you deserved.
Rarity_Neutral__You gotta walk with speed and confidence!
Rarity_Neutral__You just have to be able to admit that That's what you're feeling, so you can let it go.
Rarity_Neutral__You just received some bad Advice from that iron will character.
Rarity_Neutral__You know designers. Don't like being interrupted when they're on a creative roll.
Rarity_Neutral__You know what?
Rarity_Neutral__You know what?
Rarity_Neutral__You know what? i don't even care.
Rarity_Neutral__You lived your worst nightmare!
Rarity_Neutral__You look a little peaky.
Rarity_Neutral__You may as well not pull one at all.
Rarity_Neutral__You must have gone through so much trouble.
Rarity_Neutral__You really should bake new ones.
Rarity_Neutral__You say ?
Rarity_Neutral__You truly are a whole new Fluttershy.
Rarity_Neutral__You two? you are going to cook. make whatever you want.
Rarity_Neutral__You've got to stop being such a doormat.
Rarity_Neutral__You've lost your sparkle rainbow dash.
Rarity_Neutral__You, me.
Rarity_Neutral__Your'e a gloriously bad camper.
Rarity_Neutral__Zesty grew up around fine dining.
Rarity_Neutral__a little bit. it felt like i rushed, did i rush it?
Rarity_Neutral__and now i know exactly what to order.
Rarity_Neutral__and that you shouldn't let your worries turn a small problem.
Rarity_Neutral__by including the webs of these star spiders.
Rarity_Neutral__can't imagine why you set him free.
Rarity_Neutral__clearance bin?
Rarity_Neutral__er But i'm ready now.
Rarity_Neutral__especially when running a business.
Rarity_Neutral__honestly, how in equestria did it never occur to you to check for leaks?
Rarity_Neutral__i can look good on the outside As long as i feel good on the inside.
Rarity_Neutral__i can't believe i'm saying this But, that yellow fringe is rather bold after all.
Rarity_Neutral__i don't know what to say.
Rarity_Neutral__i don't suppose that pony's name starts with, snow?
Rarity_Neutral__i know, but there is one more sight you two simply must see before we leave.
Rarity_Neutral__i learned to know my audience.
Rarity_Neutral__i was just wondering, any chance you could see yourself with it?
Rarity_Neutral__i'll come with you and distract maud so.
Rarity_Neutral__i'm sure she can figure out what to do next.
Rarity_Neutral__in retrospect, our plan might have been, too unexpected.
Rarity_Neutral__is?
Rarity_Neutral__it's all about a tradition.
Rarity_Neutral__it's lucky for you applejack is too stubborn to relax.
Rarity_Neutral__life certainly hasn't been dull since we met.
Rarity_Neutral__maud, i can't help but notice you're staring at that marvelous giraffe.
Rarity_Neutral__maud?
Rarity_Neutral__no buts this time.
Rarity_Neutral__no, no, uh uh.
Rarity_Neutral__now, rainbow dash.
Rarity_Neutral__obviously we're on a very tight schedule.
Rarity_Neutral__of course.
Rarity_Neutral__oh Fluttershy, could you help twilight get ready?
Rarity_Neutral__oh please, i could plan a week's worth of treatments.
Rarity_Neutral__oh, i'm not sure.
Rarity_Neutral__oh, i'm so relieved to see that you like the pouch. especially considering what pinkie pie had to give up for it.
Rarity_Neutral__oh, of course.
Rarity_Neutral__oh, who needs him anyway?
Rarity_Neutral__oh, why thank you for the kind assistance, pinkie pie.
Rarity_Neutral__oh.
Rarity_Neutral__old timey is just another word for passé!
Rarity_Neutral__ooh. what's all this?
Rarity_Neutral__pinkie, put down that crayon.
Rarity_Neutral__she went home to take care of you.
Rarity_Neutral__so i thought i would surprise them With an elegant cruise.
Rarity_Neutral__so maud.
Rarity_Neutral__thanks for being my basket holder, spike.
Rarity_Neutral__that boulder of yours is such an interesting, character.
Rarity_Neutral__that is a puzzle.
Rarity_Neutral__that way, maud won't get suspicious.
Rarity_Neutral__that will only happen if this is like every other restaurant.
Rarity_Neutral__that's amazing! how did you know where he'd be?
Rarity_Neutral__the cantering cook isn't that kind of restaurant!
Rarity_Neutral__there's a certain way to do everything at the dance.
Rarity_Neutral__therefore, twilight cannot mastermind the plan.
Rarity_Neutral__they're liking it.
Rarity_Neutral__ugh! please applejack, let's not kid ourselves.
Rarity_Neutral__um hm. and i suppose if it weren't for our unsuccessful time at the spa, none of us would have realized it.
Rarity_Neutral__unless.
Rarity_Neutral__we thought you might be able to get her to um er.
Rarity_Neutral__we want to help our friends By getting them three hooves.
Rarity_Neutral__we'll simply have to start our short time at the spa with something else.
Rarity_Neutral__well isn't that something.

Rarity_Neutral__you obviously need an outside eye to evaluate the situation.
Rarity_Neutral__you're right.
Rarity_Neutral__you, shall do nothing!
Rarity_Sad Annoyed_Noisy_And ponies treat me like the sad, invisible pony i've become.
Rarity_Sad Annoyed_Noisy_I'm the one who should be mobbed by strangers wherever i go.

Rarity_Smug_Noisy_I dare Applejack to do something carefully and neatly for a change.
Rarity_Smug_Noisy_I hope you don't mind but i took the liberty of changing our music. That, rock and roll, doesn't really match my wings.
Rarity_Smug_Noisy_I'd say it's a lot more likely they'd notice that.
Rarity_Smug_Noisy_Oh, darling, whacking is a base pastime For common ponies, doesn't interest me in the least.

Rarity_Smug_Very Noisy_A unicorn's not a unicorn without grace and beauty.
Rarity_Smug_Very Noisy_And that's another thing.

Rarity_Smug__Don't you mean, inside an enigma?
Rarity_Smug__Fortunately, i can get along with anypony.
Rarity_Smug__I am not at all interested in participating in something so crude.
Rarity_Smug__I believe a certain amount of style is required.
Rarity_Smug__I think the truth of the matter is that somepony could stand to pay a little more attention to detail.
Rarity_Smug__Nice is an understatement. i look fabulous!
Rarity_Smug__Rainbow Dash and Applejack may behave like ruffians, but Rarity conducts herself with beauty and grace.

Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Rarrr!
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Rarrr!
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Scootaloo. i'm scootaloo, hi.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_She can't be a cutie mark crusader If she's already got her cutie mark.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_She's always good for some gossip.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Since rarity and applejack are out of town.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Since you don't have a cutie mark and all.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_So if you're having even the slightest problem.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_So it's back to practice!
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_So much for learning skills to be big shots.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_So what can we do?
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_So, gabriella.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_So, what did you think?
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_So, what's special about ponyville?
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_So, where's all the wonderbolt stuff?
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Something in my throat.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Something we forgot to add that both places have.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Sorry, feather. you're a little too late.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Sweetie and i can take turns!
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_That is not how you call a chicken.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_That way, when one of us gets tired, the other can take over. brilliant, huh?
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_The cutie mark crusaders are on the job.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_The cutie mark three?
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_The point is that rumble is a mad pony who must be stopped.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Then to the right, and then there's the hoop.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_There can only be one reason A pony would travel so far, so often.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_There's barrel racing.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_There's more to it than that.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_They only study super rare animals.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_They use it for decorating cakes.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_They're coming.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_This is no mess, These are the carefully arranged pieces of a unicycle I took apart and will be putting back together As soon as Twilight shows me how.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Uh, rainbow dash is practically my sister And she's a wonder bolt too.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Uh, yeah!
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Until fire streak retired, And she became an official wonderbolt!
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Wait wait wait, what happened to rainbow dash? What about the race?
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_We already have costumes.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_We are definitely not cutie mark carpenters.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_We asked every stallion in ponyville.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_We just be little ponies but, We have hearts as strong as horses!
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_We just wanted to apologize for not finding anything You liked today.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_We just wish we could've done more.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_We thought they'd come in handy in case we ever help a pony put on a play.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_We've been working with her for days!
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_We've got plans.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Well that was easy.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Well, i was thinking. For a pony who's never mixed up a potion before, You sure stirred up something fierce.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Well, i'm not giving up.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Well, we can't let rumble quit camp just because He didn't find something he's good at yet.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Well, yeah.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Well, you know.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_What is that?
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_What's that sweet tune you're singing?
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Whatever they decide applebloom, we'll be here for you.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_When is she swinging by?
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_When you were younger, huh?
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_When's it going to be our turn?
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Where's she going?
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Whoa! that sure is a lot of apples!
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Whoa.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Whoa. you always wear that shirt?
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Why all the excitement?
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Why don't you come up with the dance routine, apple bloom?
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Would you say you're pro that, or anti that?
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Yay she's amazing now if there's nothing else That concludes this meeting of the rainbow dash fan club Thank you all for coming any questions?
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Yeah that was a joke.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Yeah, i'd never believe it.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Yeah, she's making your pie delivery.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Yeah. i suppose that could get real boring.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_You don't get a cutie mark Just because you're good at something.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_You heard her.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_You just got to keep your head forward Until the very last minute, like this.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_You know, rainbow dash was right.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_You know, some ponies would dream Of having parents like that.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_You saw how shifty he was acting earlier, There's no way he'll tell us what he's doing.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_You two were kind enough to show me the rainbow dash you know.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_You've gotta take him down!
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Your brother is hiding something.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_Yup.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_as the popularity of our column grew, we got swept up in the hype.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_aw thanks, aunt holiday.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_but we ignored the guilt, because everypony seemed to want to read what we were writing.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_but, i'm not sure we can take credit for this one.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_c'mon, auntie lofty. you already have your cutie mark.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_come one, come all!
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_gabby. why do you even want a cutie mark?
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_he still has the scars to prove it.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_i'm staying with the cmcs!
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_if only somepony could prove it exists.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_isn't there something You've always wanted to do on your own?
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_legend says it has five claws and three wings.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_no.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_nope. their jobs are way too important for that.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_oh. i think the mailpony delivered your letter to my house.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_rather than boring old Flight and formation junk.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_they travel to the farthest, most dangerous places in equestria, to study unknown plants and fierce creatures.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_was worried That rainbow dash might break his speed record And so, he framed her for a crime she didn't commit.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_we knew that what we were doing didn't feel quite right.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_what about a wonderbolt quilt?
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_when the going gets tough, the tough don't notice.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Noisy_yeah, They just need a little nudge.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Very Noisy_Aw, come on, Rainbow Dash!

Scootaloo_Neutral_Very Noisy_But, we've helped a lot of ponies figure out their Purpose in life.

Scootaloo_Neutral_Very Noisy_Three types of pony coexist.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Very Noisy_Um, what are you looking for?
Scootaloo_Neutral_Very Noisy_We can hang out with you all day if you want.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Very Noisy_We don't have cutie marks.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Very Noisy_We have absolutely no shot at winning gold either.
Scootaloo_Neutral_Very Noisy_We'll give it back as soon as we're done with it!

Scootaloo_Neutral_Very Noisy_Wha! whoa!

Scootaloo_Neutral__A super awesome, dramatic song for the talent show of course.
Scootaloo_Neutral__About the dog?
Scootaloo_Neutral__After all, you're a crusader now. crusaders forever?
Scootaloo_Neutral__All we have to do is be extra special clear with her.
Scootaloo_Neutral__All we have to do now is wait for our chaperone to get here.
Scootaloo_Neutral__An apple cannon!
Scootaloo_Neutral__And Missus Cake messing up those recipes, And Spike burning the messed up recipes And.
Scootaloo_Neutral__And a dustpan, and some buckets.
Scootaloo_Neutral__And being good doesn't always mean you will.
Scootaloo_Neutral__And everything not so great.
Scootaloo_Neutral__And if finding her purpose seems impossible.
Scootaloo_Neutral__And instead of forcing ourselves To do something that's not meant for us.
Scootaloo_Neutral__And just because it hasn't happened yet, Doesn't mean it can't.
Scootaloo_Neutral__And miss the fair?!
Scootaloo_Neutral__And no spy i know has ever solved a case that quick.
Scootaloo_Neutral__And pegasi.
Scootaloo_Neutral__And things could have been a lot worse.
Scootaloo_Neutral__And trying new stuff might even make us better At helping them.
Scootaloo_Neutral__And we always will be, but i really wanna bungee jump.
Scootaloo_Neutral__And whole bunch of practice!
Scootaloo_Neutral__And you yelled at them.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Anygriff here have a problem?
Scootaloo_Neutral__Anything else?
Scootaloo_Neutral__Apple bloom, looks like it's up to you.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Are you just repeating everything i say?
Scootaloo_Neutral__Are you sure she didn't mean find their own, way?
Scootaloo_Neutral__Avoid her. yeah. how hard can that be?
Scootaloo_Neutral__Aw, come on. we did lots of stuff That didn't have anything to do with getting a cutie mark.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Because.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Besides, i don't think big mac's ready to leave just yet.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Bloofy! Treats treats treats! Who wants a treat?
Scootaloo_Neutral__But thanks to rarity, rainbow dash proved her innocence And became a back up wonderbolt.
Scootaloo_Neutral__But that wasn't the case with this. We were just helping Sugar Belle with her plan.
Scootaloo_Neutral__But we won't give up on helping you.
Scootaloo_Neutral__But we've got a plan to help you live your dream.
Scootaloo_Neutral__But what are you doing here?
Scootaloo_Neutral__But, uh, next time?
Scootaloo_Neutral__Come on crusaders, we've got to find her.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Come on crusaders.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Come on guys, i said.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Come on, apple bloom. Miss cheerilee and big mac don't Have any royal duties.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Compare them and, your decision is made for you!
Scootaloo_Neutral__Did you see the way he was acting?
Scootaloo_Neutral__Do things together. well, do everything together.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Do you fillies think that babs is worried or scared About some of this stuff?
Scootaloo_Neutral__Don't be silly.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Don't worry, we will!
Scootaloo_Neutral__Downright ridiculous.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Eavesdropping on your own fan club, isn't weird at all.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Everypony except rumble.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Except for the apple monster.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Follow my lead.
Scootaloo_Neutral__For there and back.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Great door.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Greatest napper of all time.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Grown ups always know the way.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Guess she changed her mind.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Hammer.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Hammer.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Hammer.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Have you tried lifting other things?
Scootaloo_Neutral__He does seem to like us.
Scootaloo_Neutral__He just needs a little nudge in the conversation department.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Hey apple bloom.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Hey, i thought we were gonna ask rainbow dash.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Hmm. that's good enough for me!
Scootaloo_Neutral__Hold on.
Scootaloo_Neutral__How do you think we paid for the industrial sized pet hair dryer?
Scootaloo_Neutral__I am far too powerful and dangerous!
Scootaloo_Neutral__I don't even think we're still supposed to be friends.
Scootaloo_Neutral__I don't know how much of this my scooter can take.
Scootaloo_Neutral__I don't know. but i know someone who just might.
Scootaloo_Neutral__I guess we were pretty selfish.
Scootaloo_Neutral__I guess you're right.
Scootaloo_Neutral__I just said we don't have to do everything together.
Scootaloo_Neutral__I know, i've tried.
Scootaloo_Neutral__I lose!
Scootaloo_Neutral__I love you Big Mac would you like to spend the rest of our lives together I hope you say eeyup!
Scootaloo_Neutral__I mean, i know all about speed already so.
Scootaloo_Neutral__I mean, we are kinda awesome and all.
Scootaloo_Neutral__I think I ate too many snacks.
Scootaloo_Neutral__I think I've seen her add sugar to that bowl six times so far.
Scootaloo_Neutral__I thought trains just took you where you wanted to go.
Scootaloo_Neutral__I thought you were gonna ask Applejack.
Scootaloo_Neutral__I was really thinking of going for the most creative prize.
Scootaloo_Neutral__I'm pretty sure we're all here.
Scootaloo_Neutral__If only there was something to protect her from those spines.
Scootaloo_Neutral__If rumble wants to be a wonderbolt someday, What's wrong with that?
Scootaloo_Neutral__If they go to the fair, we can tag along.
Scootaloo_Neutral__If we keep working hard, we might have a shot.
Scootaloo_Neutral__If we wanna win, i'm gonna have to fly!
Scootaloo_Neutral__In our defense, every other part of the trip was planned really well.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Is not!
Scootaloo_Neutral__Is not!
Scootaloo_Neutral__Is your talent spelling?
Scootaloo_Neutral__It just sort of, happens.
Scootaloo_Neutral__It means she could be great at anything.
Scootaloo_Neutral__It's a calling, but.
Scootaloo_Neutral__It's true. twilight's never heard of a creature Other than a pony getting a cutie mark.
Scootaloo_Neutral__It's, it's.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Just pay attention.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Keep practicing!
Scootaloo_Neutral__Let's all meet right back here tomorrow.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Let's get right down to our first order of business.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Like, crystal empire clear.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Line forms here!
Scootaloo_Neutral__Listen. some pony in our class is gonna carry that flag.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Maybe trying for the impossible isn't so bad.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Maybe we can't, but i bet i know somepony who can.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Me and my big grown up mouth.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Me neither.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Me.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Missus Cake isn't finished yet. We still have time.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Nice moves, kid.
Scootaloo_Neutral__No problem.
Scootaloo_Neutral__No! rainbow dash!
Scootaloo_Neutral__No! the greatest flyer ever to come out of cloudsdale.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Nope.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Nopony gets a mark without one.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Not quite what i had in mind.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Now that's a great picture.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Of course i need you.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Of course! what did you think she was gonna be? a pirate?
Scootaloo_Neutral__Oh, gosh. Seems like there's only room for two.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Oh, yeah.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Oh, yeah. that is a lot of work.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Only an hour?
Scootaloo_Neutral__Or even because you like it.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Or maybe not enough cloud.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Or mountain climbing!
Scootaloo_Neutral__Or.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Our hearts and hooves were in the right place.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Plus they've all done this before. i'm sure they know best.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Plus, i really want to go undercover.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Ponies with cutie mark problems are hard to find.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Practically.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Rarrr!
Scootaloo_Neutral__See, that's what your faces look like.
Scootaloo_Neutral__She's using somepony else to build herself up.
Scootaloo_Neutral__So it might as well be us!
Scootaloo_Neutral__So maybe helping is your thing.
Scootaloo_Neutral__So somehow we've gotta figure out a way to show that in the act.
Scootaloo_Neutral__So what should we do?
Scootaloo_Neutral__So you've done the doseydo to the left.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Something is definitely going on.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Such a good idea.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Sure.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Sure. we could do that.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Teach us?
Scootaloo_Neutral__Thanks mister breezy. We'll return the fan to you real soon.
Scootaloo_Neutral__That looks just like the shelf Big Mac made for Sugar Belle.
Scootaloo_Neutral__That makes us sound like we struck out.
Scootaloo_Neutral__That was Discord.
Scootaloo_Neutral__That's bon bon.
Scootaloo_Neutral__That's not important.
Scootaloo_Neutral__That's ok. sweetie belle and i can do the things we like, And you can do whatever you like.
Scootaloo_Neutral__That's what worked for us!
Scootaloo_Neutral__That's, one two three four five six seven.
Scootaloo_Neutral__That's, weird.
Scootaloo_Neutral__The official rainbow dash fan club will come to order.
Scootaloo_Neutral__The possibilities are.
Scootaloo_Neutral__The three of us tried for the longest time.
Scootaloo_Neutral__There's the core, and sour apples, and rotten apples, And apples with worms in them.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Totally, but you'll never know if you don't try.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Twilight won't let you go either, huh?
Scootaloo_Neutral__Um, actually apple bloom.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Unless.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Wait around for sugar belle to get herself Into a scary situation?
Scootaloo_Neutral__Wait, you don't know that your daughter's a wonderbolt?
Scootaloo_Neutral__We are a trio.
Scootaloo_Neutral__We better find her and find out what's going on.
Scootaloo_Neutral__We better hurry if we want to be a part of this race at all.
Scootaloo_Neutral__We both sort of got our cutie marks.
Scootaloo_Neutral__We can take a little bit of diamond tiara for a lifetime of cutie marks.
Scootaloo_Neutral__We can't give away the surprise! You need to play it cool!
Scootaloo_Neutral__We haven't tried crying yet.
Scootaloo_Neutral__We promise, fluttershy.
Scootaloo_Neutral__We promise.
Scootaloo_Neutral__We were making a table?
Scootaloo_Neutral__We'll meet you back at school.
Scootaloo_Neutral__We're its founding members.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Weeks of planning has all come down to this.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Weird.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Well i know this for sure, flying is the only way we're gonna win.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Well, i know all about rainbow dash's time in ponyville.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Well, not babs.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Well, you can't be a cutie mark crusader If you've already got your cutie mark.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Well.
Scootaloo_Neutral__What are you good at? do you play any sports?
Scootaloo_Neutral__What's important is that we do more recon.
Scootaloo_Neutral__What's sweetie belle up to?
Scootaloo_Neutral__What?
Scootaloo_Neutral__What?
Scootaloo_Neutral__Where we always do, with a good ol' fashioned crusaders chart.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Which was not my fault.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Whoa!
Scootaloo_Neutral__Why would they suspect that we're holding an invitation pie and that Missus Cake is baking a twenty one dessert proposal?
Scootaloo_Neutral__Why'd you want to meet here?
Scootaloo_Neutral__With dash on my team, how could anything go wrong?
Scootaloo_Neutral__Without you two, who's gonna hold up the hoop?
Scootaloo_Neutral__Work as a team.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Working with blank flanks one at a time takes forever.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Wow gabby, painting on a fake cutie mark To make yourself feel better?
Scootaloo_Neutral__Yeah I'm with Biscuit, The showcase looks like fun.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Yeah, for real!
Scootaloo_Neutral__Yeah, go have fun.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Yeah, miss cheerilee never lets us play buckball in class.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Yeah, we're never gonna do that again.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Yeah.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Yeah. What could go wrong?
Scootaloo_Neutral__Yeah. i'm sure we'll come across them in ponyville.
Scootaloo_Neutral__Yeah. why would we even need to know that stuff?
Scootaloo_Neutral__You can never catch me!
Scootaloo_Neutral__You did all of this?
Scootaloo_Neutral__You know what gabby?
Scootaloo_Neutral__You know, i race around so much on my scooter, Being the fastest isn't such a big deal.
Scootaloo_Neutral__You might even say, it's your purpose.
Scootaloo_Neutral__You sure about that?
Scootaloo_Neutral__You'll see. thanks, twilight.
Scootaloo_Neutral__You're not kidding.
Scootaloo_Neutral__You've all done the race before. i just figured you knew best.
Scootaloo_Neutral__aw, c'mon dad.
Scootaloo_Neutral__dad knows all about those. and cockatrices, and bugbears.
Scootaloo_Neutral__does feel kinda nice.
Scootaloo_Neutral__eh, That's all i got.
Scootaloo_Neutral__i know! i just wish they lived closer.
Scootaloo_Neutral__i'd go with them, but it's too dangerous.
Scootaloo_Neutral__it wouldn't have worked out the way it did!
Scootaloo_Neutral__let's do it.
Scootaloo_Neutral__like how i used my bungee jumping To change the sets.
Scootaloo_Neutral__thanks.
Scootaloo_Neutral__that's where their new job is.
Scootaloo_Neutral__then you'll just have to go without me!
Scootaloo_Neutral__until we remembered how every time you did something new, You tried to help everypony around you.
Scootaloo_Neutral__we're sending them to the pony book of records.
Scootaloo_Neutral__wow, apple bloom.
Scootaloo_Neutral__you called?
Scootaloo_Neutral__you must have been really upset.
Scootaloo_Sad Annoyed__Apparently we're too young to go alone.
Scootaloo_Sad Anxious_Noisy_And they're making me move to shirelanka with them!
Scootaloo_Sad Anxious_Noisy_are you sure? i don't want to get you in trouble.
Scootaloo_Sad Anxious_Noisy_if i'm not on it, they'll have to go without me.
Scootaloo_Sad Anxious_Noisy_there isn't another train to shirelanka for a month.
Scootaloo_Sad Anxious_Noisy_well it's worse for me! i have to say goodbye to.
Scootaloo_Sad Anxious_Noisy_you can't let the blank flanks down just cause i'm gone.
Scootaloo_Sad Anxious_Noisy_you gotta keep being cmcs without me!
Scootaloo_Sad Anxious__I never should have gotten her hopes up.
Scootaloo_Sad Anxious__She didn't care about me being scared or putting me in danger.
Scootaloo_Sad Anxious__She only wanted a good show, even if it meant i got hurt.
Scootaloo_Sad Anxious__The fair could be over before we find somepony to take us.
Scootaloo_Sad Anxious__is the end of the cutie mark crusaders!
Scootaloo_Sad Anxious__the only thing i see.
Scootaloo_Sad Anxious__you're making me pick between my family and my friends!
Scootaloo_Sad Shouting_Noisy_I thought i heard the headless horse, So i ran out here by myself and.
Scootaloo_Sad Shouting_Noisy_you're changing my whole life without even asking how i feel!
Scootaloo_Sad Tired_Noisy_I just, can't.
Scootaloo_Sad_Noisy_Aww.
Scootaloo_Sad_Noisy_But i don't like what i found out.
Scootaloo_Sad_Noisy_For the first time ever, the cutie mark crusaders Are cutie mark, failures.
Scootaloo_Sad_Noisy_Gabby, we, we don't.
Scootaloo_Sad_Noisy_I don't wanna see them.
Scootaloo_Sad_Noisy_I just wanted you to hang out with me And see how cool i was so you'd take me under your wing, Teach me everything you know, And become like, my big sister.
Scootaloo_Sad_Noisy_I'll find somepony else to do my hero report on.
Scootaloo_Sad_Noisy_I'm afraid rainbow dash will find out I'm not as tough as she thinks i am.
Scootaloo_Sad_Noisy_I'm so, so sorry, rainbow dash.
Scootaloo_Sad_Noisy_I'm sorry crusaders, i really thought we could help gabby.
Scootaloo_Sad_Noisy_I'm sorry for joining the washouts, Lightning dust wasn't who i thought she was.
Scootaloo_Sad_Noisy_I'm the weak link.
Scootaloo_Sad_Noisy_I,  i'm not going.
Scootaloo_Sad_Noisy_If i go, and fall, flop, or do anything but fly, i'm gonna blow it for you two.
Scootaloo_Sad_Noisy_It's hopeless.
Scootaloo_Sad_Noisy_It's no use.
Scootaloo_Sad_Noisy_Me too.
Scootaloo_Sad_Noisy_No matter what i say, there's no talking rainbow dash Out of making the fastest cart in equestria.
Scootaloo_Sad_Noisy_No, we've tried everything!
Scootaloo_Sad_Noisy_Now they'll never let us into twilight's school.
Scootaloo_Sad_Noisy_Thanks, twilight.
Scootaloo_Sad_Noisy_We can just forget about the whole griffon getting a cutie mark thing which is actually impossible.
Scootaloo_Sad_Noisy_We were supposed to help you, and.
Scootaloo_Sad_Noisy_Well. i guess you know the rest.
Scootaloo_Sad_Noisy_What if i never fly?
Scootaloo_Sad_Noisy_Yeah, sorry.
Scootaloo_Sad_Noisy_i'm gonna have to leave ponyville.
Scootaloo_Sad_Noisy_thanks for the tickets rainbow dash but, i can't go.
Scootaloo_Sad_Noisy_to stay with my aunts. you heard my parents.
Scootaloo_Sad_Noisy_we are pretty good at coming up with ideas.
Scootaloo_Sad_Noisy_you're the best, you know that?
Scootaloo_Sad_Very Noisy_Guess we'll just have to keep on doing it without you now.
Scootaloo_Sad_Very Noisy_Here i am.
Scootaloo_Sad_Very Noisy_Let's face it, nothing very juicy happens at this school.
Scootaloo_Sad_Very Noisy_Or maybe we just plain failed.
Scootaloo_Sad_Very Noisy_We'll never hear rainbow dash's story.
Scootaloo_Sad_Very Noisy_right. fun.
Scootaloo_Sad_Very Noisy_what?
Scootaloo_Sad__All we had to do was help him choose which world to live in.
Scootaloo_Sad__And surprisingly often, covered in tree sap.
Scootaloo_Sad__And what are they doing here anyway?
Scootaloo_Sad__But then you started telling those spooky stories And i got scared.
Scootaloo_Sad__But we still don't have our cutie marks.
Scootaloo_Sad__Gabby. we can't help you.
Scootaloo_Sad__I can't fly.
Scootaloo_Sad__I met your parents hoping to learn more about you.
Scootaloo_Sad__I wish we didn't have to wait to grow up.
Scootaloo_Sad__I'll never come up with anything!
Scootaloo_Sad__I'm just no good at lyrics. Coming up with words is like.
Scootaloo_Sad__I'm pretty sure if you wanted to go to the fair you could.
Scootaloo_Sad__It's not your quilt we're sad about auntie lofty.
Scootaloo_Sad__Me too.
Scootaloo_Sad__Mom and dad are back.
Scootaloo_Sad__Nope.
Scootaloo_Sad__She'll probably just ruin that one too.
Scootaloo_Sad__So that's a no on going with us to the fair?
Scootaloo_Sad__That's not the kind of pony i wanna look up to.
Scootaloo_Sad__They're supposed to be on the train.
Scootaloo_Sad__This is just awful.
Scootaloo_Sad__Tree sap and pine needles, but no cutie mark.
Scootaloo_Sad__Unless you count watching Twilight struggle to remember how she organizes her books.
Scootaloo_Sad__We worked really hard and won a prize.
Scootaloo_Sad__We're sorry.
Scootaloo_Sad__Why bother?
Scootaloo_Sad__Why?
Scootaloo_Sad__Yeah, we stink.
Scootaloo_Sad__Yeah, what's the point?
Scootaloo_Sad__growing up, i never thought i'd be the best at anything, Because no pony ever told me.
Scootaloo_Sad__how do you argue with that?
Scootaloo_Sad__i don't want to have to choose.
Scootaloo_Sad__maybe you can find a replacement for me!
Scootaloo_Sad__no pony can force two ponies to be together.
Scootaloo_Sad__really hard.
Scootaloo_Sad__thanks for trying apple bloom, but i might as well face it.
Scootaloo_Sad__their job is too important.
Scootaloo_Sad__we're sorry we haven't figured this out yet.
Scootaloo_Sarcastic_Noisy_Tlc as in tender loving care or totally lost cause?

Scootaloo_Whispering_Very Noisy_She's coming!
Scootaloo_Whispering_Very Noisy_You really think this will work?
Scootaloo_Whispering__Okay, so, what kind of crusading do we do next?

Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_A little confused, but definitely ok.
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_After you encouraged me to solve my own problem, I decided to get my project done before i left.
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_Am i bored?
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_And that's even weirder.
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_And the tree was like, what?
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_And?
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_But i can't figure out how to describe a towel.
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_But i'm glad edith was able to turn you back.
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_But it kind of makes it ok to come to you With stuff that maybe isn't super important.
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_Can we stay, headmare twilight?
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_Cockatrice's are really friendly If you know how to interact with them.
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_Did we know this was down here?
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_Did you know that they migrate To the everfree forest once a year?
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_Didn't you hear?
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_Huh, that's confusing.
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_I just found.
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_I just need a few shower adjectives.
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_I like that you're always available.
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_I only glanced at that plumbing book, But i'm pretty sure this isn't supposed to be here.
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_I think i have the shower thing under control.
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_I'll stay with him.
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_I've spent most of my life in a coral reef under water, I was a seapony, but now i'm a hippogriff, long story, Anyway.
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_Is this what boring is?
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_Like you said, dragons don't really have holidays, do they?
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_Maybe they're changing their minds about sending us home.
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_Need a lift?
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_No. really?
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_Not that i don't like the other ones.
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_Nothing. i just can't believe that's how sinks work!
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_Really?
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_Relaxing? i don't know, a nap's relaxing too.
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_Starlight, do you have a minute?

Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_This is edith. she's helping me with my project.
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_Warm and clean are ok.
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_Was that before or after discord made chocolate rain?
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_We found this, and went down, and met the tree, and gallus was all.
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_Well, at least you get to be with your family.
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_What is that?
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_Where's yona?
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_Wow. i have to give this some more thought.
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_You can't let one bad apple make you think you failed.
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_You look so weird!
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_hmm. needs more loyalty.
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_see? these are the emotions its loss made me feel.
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_she's been taking lessons.
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_wait! we all saw and heard the tree in our dream, right?
Silverstream_Neutral_Noisy_when you're done I need some synonyms for the word dry.
Silverstream_Neutral_Very Noisy_Hello?
Silverstream_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm sorry you got turned to stone looking for me.
Silverstream_Neutral_Very Noisy_Maybe i should label it.
Silverstream_Neutral_Very Noisy_Then what?.
Silverstream_Neutral_Very Noisy_They must be topside.
Silverstream_Neutral_Very Noisy_Wait. am i suspended?
Silverstream_Neutral_Very Noisy_i like my idea better.
Silverstream_Neutral_Very Noisy_lots of ings.
Silverstream_Neutral__Actually, steam has water in it.
Silverstream_Neutral__Are we still on a field trip?
Silverstream_Neutral__Cause this just feels like being lost.
Silverstream_Neutral__I totally respect my younger cousins' decisions To stay seaponies.
Silverstream_Neutral__It used to be only one day.
Silverstream_Neutral__Or, really just help explaining the concept.
Silverstream_Neutral__That don't rely on the wet part.
Silverstream_Neutral__That way i could really focus on my family During my visit.
Silverstream_Neutral__They are really fascinating creatures.
Silverstream_Neutral__To be honest.
Silverstream_Neutral__We're in.
Silverstream_Neutral__We, should, get back to studying.
Silverstream_Neutral__Why the rush to get home, smolder?
Silverstream_Neutral__how could it talk to us if it was really gone?
Silverstream_Neutral__the school was closed so i came here.
Silverstream_Neutral__you really weren't very helpful With the other stuff anyway.
Silverstream_Sad Anxious_Noisy_But but, but i have to go home!
Silverstream_Sad Anxious_Noisy_He's back and i'm never going to see another sunset Or fly through a cloud bank or study plumbing.
Silverstream_Sad Anxious_Noisy_I'm going to be trapped down here forever.
Silverstream_Sad Anxious_Noisy_What did you do!?
Silverstream_Sad Anxious_Very Noisy_But what if he is?
Silverstream_Sad Anxious_Very Noisy_He's going to take away everything i love.
Silverstream_Sad Anxious_Very Noisy_They must all be captured.
Silverstream_Sad_Noisy_I can't find any hippogriffs or seaponies.
Silverstream_Sad_Noisy_If only my family back home could see it.
Silverstream_Sad_Noisy_My mom makes the best kelp fritters.

Skeedaddle_Neutral_Noisy_so i used my fishing line to tie it back together.
Skeedaddle_Neutral_Noisy_the cmcs used their free time to set up a camp, to help us blank flanks find our cutie marks.
Skeedaddle_Neutral__even when that pony can't see it in themselves.
Skeedaddle_Neutral__the cutie mark crusaders see the best in everypony.

Sludge_Anxious_Noisy_I just wish we had more in common.
Sludge_Anxious_Noisy_I mean er, i'm happy to do whatever you want.
Sludge_Anxious_Noisy_I mean uh, i'm not sure i've fully demonstrated all the ways A dragon would live here.
Sludge_Anxious_Noisy_I want to make sure you have all the knowledge you need.
Sludge_Anxious_Noisy_I've been searching everywhere for you, kid.
Sludge_Anxious_Noisy_I-i guess i shouldn't have said anything About you being more pony than dragon.
Sludge_Anxious__I wasn't going to say anything, Since your life seems so perfect But, i have a confession to make.
Sludge_Anxious__No it doesn't!
Sludge_Anxious__You sure you don't wanna ask me something else?

Sludge_Neutral_Noisy_But, if i had a castle like this, with all this stuff.
Sludge_Neutral_Noisy_Castle, eh?
Sludge_Neutral_Noisy_Coming to ponyville, wasn't an accident. I was looking for you.
Sludge_Neutral_Noisy_Dragons like to sprawl when they get their claws done.
Sludge_Neutral_Noisy_Enjoy livin' pony town.
Sludge_Neutral_Noisy_I don't need to explain myself to a couple of baby dragons.
Sludge_Neutral_Noisy_I'd probably just lay around all day Doing nothing like a real dragon.
Sludge_Neutral_Noisy_I'm not your father!
Sludge_Neutral_Noisy_I'm taking this pillow.
Sludge_Neutral_Noisy_If you think doing everything on this incredibly long list, Is gonna fill the hole where your dragonishness should be.

Sludge_Neutral_Noisy_To what?
Sludge_Neutral_Noisy_Uh, spike?
Sludge_Neutral_Noisy_What do you wanna do first?
Sludge_Neutral_Noisy_You're barely a dragon at all.
Sludge_Neutral_Noisy_Your mother was the best dragon i'd ever met.
Sludge_Neutral_Noisy_ah, Don't worry about it.
Sludge_Neutral_Noisy_aw, shucks.
Sludge_Neutral_Noisy_but finding the migration route could take a lifetime, and you deserved a chance.
Sludge_Neutral_Noisy_don't look at me like that, kid.
Sludge_Neutral_Noisy_past mount aris, the abandoned home of the hippogriffs.
Sludge_Neutral_Noisy_so i went looking for her, carried your egg to places no dragon, or pony, has ever been.
Sludge_Neutral_Noisy_the dragon lord even picked her to scout for the great migration and.
Sludge_Neutral_Noisy_where i was forced to choose between surrendering myself.
Sludge_Neutral_Very Noisy_or surrendering your egg.
Sludge_Neutral_Very Noisy_to a prison world, of dragon hunters.
Sludge_Neutral__Because, that's where your mother's trail finally led.
Sludge_Neutral__Hey, i saw an opportunity and i took it.
Sludge_Neutral__How are your tails shaking?
Sludge_Neutral__I did what any dragon would do.
Sludge_Neutral__I just said that to get in on this sweet castle life.
Sludge_Neutral__I'll manage. dragons take care of themselves.
Sludge_Neutral__Name's sludge.
Sludge_Neutral__Now go get my some more.
Sludge_Neutral__Oh well, have you heard of the land of the scale collectors?

Sludge_Neutral__Twilight basically raised you as a pony.
Sludge_Neutral__Well, ask away!
Sludge_Neutral__Well, i hope you're not expecting me to fix it.
Sludge_Neutral__Well, the crash part wasn't on purpose but, heading here was.
Sludge_Neutral__You're pretty lucky to have friends like these, kid.
Sludge_Sad Anxious_Noisy_You make it sound so simple. I wish you'd been there to help me search.
Sludge_Sad Anxious_Noisy_and even though she'd just laid your egg, we knew she'd have to go.
Sludge_Sad_Noisy_It's a lot of painful memories.
Sludge_Sad_Noisy_a to know your mother.
Sludge_Sad_Noisy_and that's where i've been ever since.
Sludge_Sad_Noisy_of course, there was no way i was gonna sacrifice my boy.
Sludge_Sad_Noisy_so they took me instead.

Smolder_Confused_Noisy_What?
Smolder_Confused_Noisy_What?
Smolder_Confused_Noisy_You did this?
Smolder_Confused_Noisy_the what lock what?
Smolder_Confused_Very Noisy_Ocellus?
Smolder_Confused__Have you been living with ponies your whole life?
Smolder_Confused__Huh?
Smolder_Confused__Huh?
Smolder_Confused__Is that a pony thing?
Smolder_Confused__The elements of harmony grew the tree?
Smolder_Confused__Um, is that it?
Smolder_Confused__rebuild what, exactly?
Smolder_Fear_Very Noisy_ah! Not cool!
Smolder_Happy_Noisy_Ah! the stink of sulfur, sharp rocks under my claws.
Smolder_Happy_Noisy_And fun!
Smolder_Happy_Noisy_Congrats!
Smolder_Happy_Noisy_I found the perfect cave where you two can live.
Smolder_Happy_Noisy_I've missed you bro! we got a lot of fun to catch up on.
Smolder_Happy_Noisy_It's good to be home.
Smolder_Happy_Noisy_Oh, yeah, i dig.
Smolder_Happy_Noisy_Spike!
Smolder_Happy_Noisy_There aren't even any comfortable rocks inside.
Smolder_Happy_Noisy_Wahoo!
Smolder_Happy_Noisy_ok! lava jumping, just like old times, huh gargar?
Smolder_Happy_Noisy_you did it, gargar! you performed in front of other dragons!
Smolder_Happy_Very Noisy_Come on in! the lava's fine!
Smolder_Happy_Very Noisy_I take back everything i said about you, That was cool.
Smolder_Happy__Congrats!
Smolder_Happy__may i have some tea, please?
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Actually, i'll be gone for a week.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_All i had to do was follow the smoke.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_All of us did.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_And why are you talking so funny?
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_And yaks are actually good at jokes. How about that?
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_At all.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Because she's teaching you to fly like a pony instead of a dragon.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_But ever since school started, i've realized that, sometimes, I kinda don't mind cute stuff.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_But mainly fast.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_But yeah, hanging out with other creatures Is actually, not bad.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_But you're right. That was pretty amazing, even by dragon standards.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_But, garble is my brother.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Bwahahah!
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Can you be weirder than a flying yak?
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Does it have a depressing ending?
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Doesn't make any sense.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Dragon. strange magical cave. what do you think i'm doing?
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Easy guys, i learned at twilight's school, ganging up on each other isn't half as cool as you think.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Eh, works for me.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Eh. i've heard worse suggestions.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Even i'm impressed.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Every dragon gets together and tells stories.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_He just needs friends who can appreciate that part.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_He's definitely weird, but in a fun way.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Hey, don't forget the dragons in this one!
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Hey, what's that?
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Honestly, this is dragon one oh one.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_How about you just tell us What's on tomorrow's test, professor?
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Humongous birds of prey that can snack on a molting dragon like candy.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_I don't trust her.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_I hope he doesn't come back and lock us up again.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_I hope you know where you're going.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_I know the tree would've liked that.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_I mean, i loved my brother and all, but one whiff and i was all, see ya!
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_I want to go home and check on him.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_I was gonna invite you to a top secret tea party with me, But if you want to stay down here.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_I'm guessing that one.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_I'm not sure those are the kind of things my brother's gonna be into.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_I'm sure you'll find a nice, hoard of gems to guard or a village to terrorize.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_I, guess not.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_If a dragon like me can admit she likes, tea parties, That's proof we can change.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_If you're trying to hide, you need to do a better job.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Is it ok if i miss class?
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_It must be hard growing up not really knowing who you are.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_It was called, a dream come true.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_It's all part of growing up dragon.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_It's just kinda weird, isn't it?
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_It's ok gargar.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_It, did call us all here.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Just one problem.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Let's save time and cut to the chase.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Like, why'd she change her mind?
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Long story short.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Maybe dragons and griffons are just too tough for friendship.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Maybe to you. But dragons like hearing about weak Kind creatures getting defeated.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Me too.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Meh.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_No claws, no wings, no fire. What is it exactly you're proud of?
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_No. we're going back to school.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Not exactly.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Now this, i'm interested in.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Of all the strange things that have happened tonight, that's the strangest, right?
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Once upon a time, there was this sad little dragon.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Pretty soon you'll leave and strike out on your own.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Seriously, i heard none of that.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_She's gone full pony for the dance.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_So, did you tell them you did it?
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_So, sludge just lays around While you wait on him claw and tail?
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Sorry to bug you in the teachers' lounge.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Speaking of which.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Super painful stone scales, fire burps.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Sure!
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_That molt stench is a magnet for predators, tatzlwurms, hydras, rocs.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_That's exactly what we're doing.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_That's totally different.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_That's why he's been so sad.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_The best one wins a pile of gemstones.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Uh, dragons are rude and rebellious, But they aren't lazy lumps who take advantage of their kids.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Usually dragon parents teach this stuff.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_We can still get back to school before dark if we cross that ravine and stop doubling back.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_We still haven't decided what we should do for the tree.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_We were kinda gonna ask you the same thing.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Well yeah.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Well, in the dragon lands, a molter's loved ones kicks them out at the first stone scale.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Well, it worked, didn't it?
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Well, maybe a burned marshmallow.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Well, we do have the feast of fire.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_What's it called again ocellus?
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Why don't you tell me everything sludge said About being a dragon.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Wow! i have seen some pretty bad molts in my time, but yours takes the cake.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Yeah just ignore them, gargar.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Yeah, dragons don't do pony holidays.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Yeah, that was us.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Yeah, what's the point of this, exactly?
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Yeah. he's sorta like you, spike.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_Yeah. we all just lived it.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_You already live in ponyville.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_You're a changeling, Just change back.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_boring.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_but my friends have taught me to celebrate them!
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_but one night, as she sat alone in a storm, she heard something.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_give him a chance, garble. you guys have a lot in common.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_he usually hangs out near here, i'll go try and find him.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_i'm the only one garble will perform for.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_if we're gonna honor it, we need to do better than that.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_just, having spike and me accept him for who he is will make a huge difference.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_like you.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_oh, we're not here for school.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_or a really big and imposing monument, so everycreature knows how powerful the tree was!
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_scales was scared, but the dragon lord told her not to be afraid, that he was taking her to the dragon lands for a great feast.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_she lived alone in the wilderness, with nothing to eat.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_thanks! the dragonlord is way too busy for personal problems when it's baby dragon hatching season.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_the tree of harmony is a huge part of equestrian history.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_uh It's not that, it's just, Dragons don't really use pillows.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_wanna go? i got nothing better to do.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_yeah no but good try.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_yeah. like a bunch of different parts all smooshed together.
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_you coming?
Smolder_Neutral_Noisy_you're not changing your mind about helping me cheer him up are you?
Smolder_Neutral_Very Noisy_About as good as the apple shed building.
Smolder_Neutral_Very Noisy_But i live in the school. Nothing says we have to live outside.
Smolder_Neutral_Very Noisy_It isn't just another friendship school, it's a university!
Smolder_Neutral_Very Noisy_Ooooh. spike? you ok?
Smolder_Neutral_Very Noisy_Or just, one of the weirdest?
Smolder_Neutral_Very Noisy_So we can shut it down By yanking one of these things out, right?
Smolder_Neutral_Very Noisy_So, when do we get to the part when we move?
Smolder_Neutral_Very Noisy_Uh, this isn't mine.
Smolder_Neutral_Very Noisy_We aren't leaving without them.
Smolder_Neutral_Very Noisy_Y'know, dragons? Having a firebreathing competition?
Smolder_Neutral_Very Noisy_You think that new pony is gonna be the weirdest teacher at school?
Smolder_Neutral_Very Noisy_and forced the dragon lord to live out in the cold, just as she used to.
Smolder_Neutral_Very Noisy_garble!
Smolder_Neutral_Very Noisy_her name was scales.
Smolder_Neutral_Very Noisy_it was the dragon lord!
Smolder_Neutral_Very Noisy_making a memorial statue of the tree. When creatures see this, they'll be super impressed.
Smolder_Neutral_Very Noisy_scales sat with the dragon lord's family and friends, and had the biggest, best dinner of gemstones she'd ever eaten.
Smolder_Neutral_Very Noisy_she claimed the bloodstone scepter, and took over the dragon lands!
Smolder_Neutral_Very Noisy_she saw her chance, and took it!
Smolder_Neutral_Very Noisy_then, while the dragons were telling stories, scales thought it would be so easy to seize power, from this feeble and sensitive dragon lord.
Smolder_Neutral__All the tough guy stuff is just an act.
Smolder_Neutral__But I've seen how powerful it can be!
Smolder_Neutral__But dragons are better than this.
Smolder_Neutral__Cause this doesn't sound like compromising at all.
Smolder_Neutral__Especially at the ravine.
Smolder_Neutral__Every dragon goes through it.
Smolder_Neutral__Face it. we're stuck here.
Smolder_Neutral__Fluttershy won't think you're soft for being a poet.
Smolder_Neutral__Friendship is in our nature.
Smolder_Neutral__Greed induced bigness.
Smolder_Neutral__Guess we aren't just any dragon and griffon anymore.
Smolder_Neutral__He hasn't written any poetry since i left.
Smolder_Neutral__He's a big marshmallow.
Smolder_Neutral__He's a really sweet guy And the other dragons can be kinda rough.
Smolder_Neutral__I can't under, was that, sleeves made of foam?
Smolder_Neutral__I guess pony holidays can't be that bad.
Smolder_Neutral__I haven't even told you about the smell.
Smolder_Neutral__I know helping other creatures by being kind and generous sounds lame.
Smolder_Neutral__I think it's biological.
Smolder_Neutral__I'll go first.
Smolder_Neutral__I'm not afraid of anything.
Smolder_Neutral__It would have been so much easier to just fly home.
Smolder_Neutral__Like you told us to?
Smolder_Neutral__No.
Smolder_Neutral__Not much of a choice.
Smolder_Neutral__Oh, i didn't say that.
Smolder_Neutral__Oh.
Smolder_Neutral__Oh. sorry.
Smolder_Neutral__Ok, but let's keep this between us.
Smolder_Neutral__R o cs. rocs.
Smolder_Neutral__Smoky on the outside, but squishy inside.
Smolder_Neutral__Spike, i think it's really nice that you're trying to cheer up gargar.
Smolder_Neutral__Still locked, huh?
Smolder_Neutral__That's not who you are anymore.
Smolder_Neutral__That's ridiculous.
Smolder_Neutral__The molt is completely normal.
Smolder_Neutral__The molt?
Smolder_Neutral__There's no lava diving at school.
Smolder_Neutral__Though now that dragons and ponies are friends, I guess that's off the table.
Smolder_Neutral__To pack?
Smolder_Neutral__Uncontrollable volume shifts.
Smolder_Neutral__We call it, the molt effect.
Smolder_Neutral__What?
Smolder_Neutral__Why did starlight write a note Instead of say goodbye to us herself?
Smolder_Neutral__Why would they?
Smolder_Neutral__Yeah, what happened?
Smolder_Neutral__You know those long lectures about friendship you gave at school?
Smolder_Neutral__You never know what's gonna happen next with him.
Smolder_Neutral__You've changed.
Smolder_Neutral__ah! good idea, gallus!
Smolder_Neutral__and neither would anydragon who was your real friend.
Smolder_Neutral__besides, he came here to hang out with you, garble.
Smolder_Neutral__dragons who appreciate his more sensitive side.
Smolder_Neutral__for a pony without a horn, she's sure got a point.
Smolder_Neutral__my brother's been having a hard time Since i left for school.
Smolder_Sarcastic Annoyed_Noisy_Yeah, well one of these new friends Has gotten us all in trouble.
Smolder_Sarcastic_Noisy_Apparently, yaks no love study groups.
Smolder_Sarcastic_Noisy_Except maybe stand on stage.
Smolder_Sarcastic_Noisy_Gee, thanks.
Smolder_Sarcastic_Noisy_Is there anything in yakyakistan that isn't the best?
Smolder_Sarcastic_Noisy_Mind? it's a tree.
Smolder_Sarcastic_Noisy_Right, to help us disadvantaged creatures.
Smolder_Sarcastic_Noisy_That's a great story. And you told it really well.
Smolder_Sarcastic_Noisy_That's all very sweet.
Smolder_Sarcastic_Noisy_Uh, did you miss the part where he said he didn't want Anything to do with us?
Smolder_Sarcastic_Noisy_that's your version of a bad dream?
Smolder_Sarcastic_Noisy_yeah, like some rainbow art project was better?
Smolder_Sarcastic_Noisy_you mean gone?
Smolder_Sarcastic__Yeah, that totally seems like something they would do.
Smolder_Shouting_Noisy_I like cute, silly stuff!
Smolder_Shouting_Noisy_Pillow fight!
Smolder_Smug_Noisy_I thought that might work, Come on, let's go!
Smolder_Smug_Noisy_The tree said so.
Smolder_Smug_Noisy_competition. Who's up for a race?
Smolder_Smug__No. it isn't.
Smolder_Smug__What do you say, ocellus?
Smolder_Tired_Noisy_I'm actually too tired to do anything right now.
Snails_Fear Shouting__Get off of me!
Snails_Neutral_Very Noisy_She's getting weirder and weirder!
Snails_Sad__Why is she so mean to us?
Snails_Shouting_Noisy_Good spell oh great and powerful trixie!
Snails_Tired_Very Noisy_I'm telling you, snips,.
Snap Shutter_Happy__Good on ya scoot.

Snap Shutter_Neutral_Noisy_Hmm. easy enough. we'll follow the spoor.
Snap Shutter_Neutral_Noisy_crikey! you're nearly as tall as me now scoot.
Snap Shutter_Neutral_Noisy_i think it means you'll stay best friends no matter where you go. and that's really special.
Snap Shutter_Neutral_Noisy_our work is our life's purpose. we could never quit.
Snap Shutter_Neutral_Noisy_rabid bugbears couldn't keep us away.
Snap Shutter_Neutral_Noisy_scoot? are these yours?
Snap Shutter_Neutral_Noisy_so there's no way we could ask you to do the same.
Snap Shutter_Neutral_Noisy_we just sold the house scoot.
Snap Shutter_Neutral_Noisy_we'll stay in town for the weekend, so you can pack your things.
Snap Shutter_Neutral_Noisy_well i'll be a three tailed bandicoot.

Snap Shutter_Neutral_Very Noisy_easy there, marshmallow!
Snap Shutter_Neutral_Very Noisy_time you were in your crate for your nap!
Snap Shutter_Neutral__Oh, you'll be seeing plenty of us.
Snap Shutter_Neutral__i had no idea how important scoot's club was.

Snap Shutter_Neutral__just brought back a few mates from our last adventure.
Snap Shutter_Neutral__or they can take the train to us. there's one every month.
Snap Shutter_Neutral__scoot, if you want to stay, we understand.

Snap Shutter_Neutral__we can't miss tomorrow's train.
Snap Shutter_Neutral__we just kept discovering things that could help equestria, and nopony else had the experience to finish our job.
Snap Shutter_Neutral__we never planned to be away for so long in the first place.
Snap Shutter_Neutral__which is a long way to say.
Snap Shutter_Neutral__yeah but you don't have the same cutie mark.
Snap Shutter_Neutral__you can come back and visit 'em.
Snap Shutter_Neutral__you have an important job, that only you can do.

Soarin_Anxious_Noisy_Are you ok, rainbow dash?
Soarin_Anxious_Noisy_But you'll never make it in time!
Soarin_Anxious_Very Noisy_But uh, i'm sure it'll be okay by the competition.
Soarin_Anxious_Very Noisy_The crystal mountains are too far for anypony To make it there and back before the royal garden opening!
Soarin_Anxious__Uh.

Soarin_Happy__I'm so glad i made it to las pegasus, before the fastest most thrilling ride of all time closes for good!
Soarin_Happy__Only the coolest roller coaster ever!
Soarin_Happy__Really?
Soarin_Neutral_Noisy_Because i clipped my wing on a flagpole As i was landing on my first day.
Soarin_Neutral_Noisy_Eh you'd be talkin' to me.
Soarin_Neutral_Noisy_Huh, nice to see there's some real competition here.
Soarin_Neutral_Noisy_I have to warn you, if you sent that letter, the by laws are clear.
Soarin_Neutral_Noisy_I'd have no choice but to ban you from the wonderbolts, forever.

Soarin_Neutral_Noisy_Kay what's happening?
Soarin_Neutral_Noisy_Me too. in the meantime, we need you to fly in her place.
Soarin_Neutral_Noisy_Rainbow dash, spitfire's mom sent a message saying she was sick.
Soarin_Neutral_Noisy_Rainbow dash, we need you to fly in spitfire's place!
Soarin_Neutral_Noisy_She's right! wonderbolts look after each other.

Soarin_Neutral_Noisy_So, i guess we're all outta luck.
Soarin_Neutral_Noisy_So, would you like to fly with us?
Soarin_Neutral_Noisy_Somepony who wanted her out of the show i suppose.
Soarin_Neutral_Noisy_Spitfire came by my room and told me She had to go see her mom at around midnight.
Soarin_Neutral_Noisy_Thanks.
Soarin_Neutral_Noisy_They're too busy practicing i guess.
Soarin_Neutral_Noisy_Where were you then?

Soarin_Neutral_Noisy_You sure have nice friends. nopony has been by to visit me.
Soarin_Neutral_Noisy_my wing hurts.

Soarin_Neutral__Then you can still fly with us.
Soarin_Neutral__Understand?
Soarin_Neutral__Unless spitfire comes back, yes.

Sombra_Smug_Noisy_now, how shall i eliminate all this clutter in my throne room?
Sombra_Smug_Noisy_of course you are.
Sombra_Smug_Noisy_oh yes. and i think i know exactly where i'll start.

Sombra_Smug_Very Noisy_i will take back the crystal empire on my own!
Sombra_Smug_Very Noisy_oh, but i already have.
Sombra_Smug_Very Noisy_without your elements, it would be so easy to control you.

Sombra_Smug__or what?
Somnambula_Anxious_Noisy_And quickly.
Somnambula_Anxious_Noisy_That is a riddle we must unravel.
Somnambula_Neutral_Noisy_Each of us infused a crystal seed with our magic, In hopes that it would grow into a force for good.
Somnambula_Neutral_Noisy_Focus on my voice, and feel yourself unlock your potential.
Somnambula_Neutral_Noisy_Imagine, everything that troubles you as one big cloud.

Spike_Anxious Tired_Very Noisy_Okay, thank you!
Spike_Anxious Tired_Very Noisy_Twilight, wait! i'm coming with you.
Spike_Anxious Whispering_Noisy_Garble isn't very nice to sensitive dragons.

Spike_Anxious_Noisy_And sometimes, when no one's around, i do this.
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_And then the thing just, lit!
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_And then you might end up taking a giant step Backwards instead of forwards!
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_And thorax is.
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_And what about the ceremonial dragon fire flame of friendship?
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_And your superpower is controlling the mighty forces of nature!

Spike_Anxious_Noisy_Hey, wait up! i'm an important part of this team, remember!?
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_Honestly twilight, i don't even want to tell you How late we are.
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_Horsey hive covered foals counting on us, remember?
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_How are my spines, are they straight?
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_Huh, lucky me.
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_Huh?
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_Huh?
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_I completely forgot.
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_I could be responsible for starting a war, That could ruin equestria as we know it!
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_I didn't realize it was the same day i invited ember!
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_I don't know what happened, I just had a sudden case of.
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_I don't know!
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_I don't know!
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_I don't know!
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_I don't know, i mean if we skip it, the whole lesson could go south.
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_I don't want to be dragon lord, or dragon toast, And i stopped glowing, so let's sneak out of here!
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_I had a bowl full of them here, and now i don't!
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_I had no idea we had spiders in the castle.
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_I have lots of reasons.
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_I have so many questions.
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_I have, no idea.
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_I just don't understand why none of your advice is helping.
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_I know it's already ten but, i'm scaly tailed and bright eyed.
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_I know you told me to stay up there but you were down here for such a long time and you weren't answering and i got worried so i came down here.
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_I mean, big mac.
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_I mean, i'm psyched.
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_I need answers! i feel like i'm.
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_I promised i'll keep all of it between the three of us.
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_I said come back here!
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_I thought it just meant like, the comics they sold there, had really enchanting storylines!
Spike_Anxious_Noisy_I tried to save them but it's all i can do to stop scratching long enough to dive out of the way when that bird attacks!

Spike_Anxious__I think it's all that ice cream.

Spike_Anxious__I'm just not sure how the bird feels about it.

Spike_Neutral_Noisy_And sometimes, even dragons need help.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_And that office would be?
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_And that the map's still here.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_And that you don't have to have superpowers, to be a super friend.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_And the three leaders returned home to lick their wounds.

Spike_Neutral_Noisy_How about this one?
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_How about this?
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_How about, a medium amount of dirty, Not too little, not to much, Just right.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_How are you supposed to read twelve books in one weekend?
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_Huh, i shouldn't have doubted you.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_Huh, maybe we should have skipped highlighting The importance of the meeting after all.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_Huh, would you know, we're way ahead of schedule. I credit your extremely competent assistant.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_Huh. i guess a boat trip qualifies as that.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_Huh? sorry, twilight.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I always wanted to be a super spy.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I am serious. he wants to be friends.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I am, super busy all day, giving, tours of the school.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I better break the news to twilight!
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I can do it!
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I can keep track of the friendship log, Boost community morale and answer fan mail for a few days.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I can't help it!
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I command you to do it!
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I count to ten, and by the time i've done.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I definitely like the idea of hibernation.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I didn't think that itching would ever stop.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I do know she could have told garble about you, But she didn't. i think we can trust her.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I don't know what got into me.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I don't think i'll need all these candles, twilight.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I don't think it works that way.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I don't think leaning is gonna help.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I don't think she took it as well as you think she took it.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I don't think the eggs are shaking 'cause they're afraid. they're cold.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I don't think there's another unicorn in all of equestria with your kind of ability, Twilight.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I don't want any of that girly frilly froufrou nonsense.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I dunno, twilight. i don't see any disasters.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I er, guess i don't understand dragon customs.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I gotta work on my official speech.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I guess I better get back upstairs and clean the library.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I guess i don't need the disguise after all.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I guess sometimes the best plan is the one you expect.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I guess the princess hasn't heard we found cerberus yet.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I guess we could start with this.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I have to win the gauntlet of fire!
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I hide from it.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I hope so.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I hope this plan of yours works.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I hope you don't mind.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I invited dragon lord ember to ponyville today.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I just really really want to know how they made it back.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I just want things to be perfect.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I know but, what do you think happened?
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I know i saw a magnifying glass laying around last time i was here.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I know it's wrong to cut corners when it comes to gifts from the heart but, this is an emergency, right?
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I know twilight so well it's, easy to make decisions like her!
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I know what that's like.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I know where it is.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I know you said nopony can help, but i'm no pony!
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I know, right?
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I know. i promise i won't lift a claw to help you.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I may have been born a dragon, but equestria and my pony friends.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I mean, wow, really regal and important, he he.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I might have an idea.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I present the dragon fire flame of friendship, To both dragon lord ember And thorax, leader of the changeling pack.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I promise! i won't let you down!
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I said no.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I stand where you tell me until you give me the signal.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I take it flurry named it?
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I take it we're going to canterlot?
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I think discord's trying to test you.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I think if you made a little effort.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I think it's time they met chief thunderhooves.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I think what gummy's trying to say is.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I think you should probably just take, all of them.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I think, this guy needs you.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I think, what gummy is trying to say, is that he'd like a little spike time.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I told ya.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I uh, ate them all.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I was always excited to be a part of twilight's And shining armor's rivalry, like i was their little brother.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I wasn't hiding when i beat you down the ridge.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I will be the bigger dragon. i will be the bigger dragon. I will be the bigger dragon. i will be the bigger dragon.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I wonder what she has planned for him.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I wondered where that lava was coming from. They must be draining it from the underground lake!
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I would love to.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I wouldn't count on it.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I'll be right back.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I'll get you some punch.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I'll pass out the shields.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I'll see if i can find the map somewhere in the castle.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I'm Spike, okay?
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I'm glad to help rarity, but don't you think there's wonderful things about flying that, don't involve dresses?
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I'm glad you've come to your senses.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I'm gonna stay up and watch over you guys just in case!
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I'm gonna tell you two a secret, but you have to promise not to tell anyone.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I'm jokin', i'm jokin'!
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I'm just being honest.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I'm just glad to be back.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I'm not a detective, but i think we've got a suspect.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I'm not tired. I do fine on my own.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I'm pretty sure dragons don't like flowers.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I'm sorry, Twilight.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I'm sorry, but i've made up my mind.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I'm sure i don't know what you're talking about.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I'm sure the princess will forgive you if you miss one little deadline.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I'm thinking she's headed, this way.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I've also packed a telescope, apples, bananas, fruit punch.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I've calmed myself enough to get the job done right everytime.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_I've got a little something i need to attend to.

Spike_Neutral_Noisy_Yep.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_You blamed cutie marks, and stripped a whole village of theirs, And when twilight and the others stopped you, You went back in time and almost destroyed equestria.

Spike_Neutral_Noisy_You know the worst thing about you Being the princess of friendship?
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_You know, i'm supposed to be watching him, But you all have just hit it off so well that, maybe.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_You know, she's not the only pony with a pet That might need some watching.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_You mean it was keeping her isolated and alone?
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_You must be hungry from your travels.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_You realize that might just be a you thing right?
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_You said it, big mac!
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_You said you had something else you needed me to do?
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_You should talk to twilight about it.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_You sure you don't need any help?

Spike_Neutral_Noisy_all through the night, The three ponies kept the fire of friendship alive.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_and no more than, one half, turn.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_and that's why you should never let cupcake flavors Get in the way of your friendship.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_and why would you deny yourself presents and candy?
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_apparently, it's a celebration of all the swans in the royal lake.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_but he'll never guess twilight's plan.
Spike_Neutral_Noisy_dear twily, hope your idea isn't just.

Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_And the best part is.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_And the detail on his face is pretty good.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_And the unicorns were freezing and hungry.

Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_I also learned, that there's plenty of love for every friend to share.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_I bet they've taken rarity down the tunnel with the most gems.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_I brought my cider testing cup. are you ready to go try the samples?
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_I could tell these delegates anything, As long as they think it came from twilight.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_I decided to compete. i am a dragon after all.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_I didn't help twilight with that part.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_I do have a long list of things i've been dying to do.

Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_I don't care what she says. that makes us friends.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_I don't think i can write another word.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_I don't think you'll have to.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_I don't think you'll have to.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_I guess. they were all on a ship that sank and.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_I have no idea what you're talking.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_I heard she wasn't very happy The last time you saw her.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_I just don't get it.

Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_I mean, you rocketed those boulders at them like they were, rockets!
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_I mean, you're a dragon and I'm a dragon.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_I need to repay the favor.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_I sleep like a baby under that cold, cavernous ceiling.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_I think maybe you're missing.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_I thought unicorns were only supposed to have a little magic that matches their special talents.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_I thought, there's no way i could.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_I was just gonna say, we're here.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_I was really hoping to get er, this thingy!
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_I was really only scared for a second.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_I was supervising. and then zephyr asked me about Different cleaning techniques and which one was best.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_I wouldn't want the presence of spike the brave and glorious To turn it into some kind of circus.

Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_If i can check a few of these meetings off twilight's schedule, Then when she wakes up, she won't have to think About anything but the reception.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_If i wasn't supposed to have it, it wouldn't be so easy to get!

Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Mind reading must be just around the corner.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Missed that.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Mmm, outshines is right.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Morning, starlight!
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Never fear, Spike, your number one assistant, is here!
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Next door on the left.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_No pony had ever seen paradise before.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_No twilight. you can.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Nopony could blame you for that.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Not if i find the right disguise, it won't.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Not spying.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Now get out there.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Now that the mystery's been solved, let's get out here huh?

Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, i know all about that.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, wait, er, I was probably supposed to give you this one first.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, yeah.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Ok, but if the boat sank, how did you all get rescued?
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Ok. i think we've had enough of the aloof master of chaos' remedies for a broken heart.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Once it bursts into flames from brain power, i'll send another one for you.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Once you survive discord, Anything else is a piece of cake.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_One ding, nick or dent, and this power ponies comic book wouldn't be in perfect mint condition anymore.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Or they'll miss the princess raise the sun.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Patiently waiting decades, no! centuries.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Please twilight, just give me this.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Ponies, please.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Probably to become a world famous fashion designer i bet.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Quill.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Rainbow dash is jealous.

Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_She did one on me.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_She saved me, even when she didn't have to.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_She's great.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_She's strong. She's beautiful.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Shouldn't be too hard.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Since sometime in the last three days i guess.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Since the beginning of time.

Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_That truly express the essence of their very souls.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_That's a really big one.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_That's about it.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_That's it. we've got to go talk to applejack.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_That's strange.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_That's the last of your bags.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_That, is not the reaction we expected.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_The electro orb!
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_The elite of equestria have longed for pony fashions.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_The last time we came to the crystal empire, There was a lot going on with the new baby And the crystalling.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_The normally industrious earth ponies Were unable to farm their land.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_The pegasi were the stewards of the weather.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_The roar was spot on.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_The unicorns demanded the same.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Then they all share the light and joy they feel, Feeding it into the crystal that joins with the heart, And increases its power!
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_There is more to a young pony's life than studying.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_There you are, rarity!
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_There's also supposed to be a castle that goes with it.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_They called themselves the diamond dogs.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Think of how much quicker they could wrap up winter with your magic.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_This here's little strongheart.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_This is Spike, writing to you about my adventures.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_This is cosy.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_This is my chance.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_This is unexpected.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_This place looks a lot cleaner than i remember it.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_This steam is great for my complexion.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_This week, I learned that being jealous, and telling lies, gets you nowhere in friendship.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_This year's ponyville day's festival, designed by rarity.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_This year's ponyville day's festival, pony of ceremonies.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Thought we'd meet you at the station!

Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_We've already dropped off your cape at the cleaner's.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, i know all the words to our anthem.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, i learned that it truly is better to give than to receive.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, i started out As a cute little purple and green egg.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, if sunburst is that good at magic, Maybe he'd appreciate your uh.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, it didn't go exactly the way i thought.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, suit yourself.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, that didn't work.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, that's all in the past. The only thing that matters now is that we're together.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, we'll just have to figure out who the real one is then.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, you might think that it would feel good To get lots and lots of stuff.

Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Whoa! that strange yellow orb in the sky!
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Why don't you just use magic twilight and get it done the right way?
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Why don't you just use that memory spell you used to fix everypony when discord was here?
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Will feature various high class events, such as.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Will rainbow dash make it on time?
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_With pleasure, twilight.

Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_You got the clomping of his claws.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_You happened.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_You know pinkie, these two ponies have a bit of a grudge match they're trying to settle, trying to prove who's the most athletic.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_You know what?
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_You know. 'cause you used to be famous For being such a bad friend.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_You really should lighten up, twilight.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_You think it's scary now, just wait until it's done.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_You're getting worked up about nothin'.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_You've already make things look really really great.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_Zecora's cure for the cutie pox?
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_and if all else fails, ask them to share an embarrassing moment from their past.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_and one for you spike.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_and that's how we found the crystal heart, Defeated king sombra, and saved the empire.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_and the blizzard raged on.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_but giving her the space to make her own decisions worked pretty well.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_but what about your late fees?
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_captain wuzz? can you hear me?!
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_dear princess celestia.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_er, I don't think we need to sneak around twilight.

Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_hmm, maybe not the best plan.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_i don't know why we keep running out at the castle.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_i don't know.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_i don't remember him saying he didn't want to be friends.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_i know, i know, stop fooling around.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_i know.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_i need to refill my cocoa.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_i thought this was just an unofficial, casual visit.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_in return for magically bringing forth day and night.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_isn't that how celestia taught you?
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_it's like a ghost town.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_it's not your fault.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_maybe you're a better teacher than you thought.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_maybe, even something they regret.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_my arms aren't usually this long, either.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_ok, new activity. who wants to make vision boards?
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_ok. step two, close the gate.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_ordered new parchment and quills from the stationery shop.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_perplexing pony plagues, perhaps?
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_proceed.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_ps, obviously spike, did not have to learn a lesson because he is the best, most awesome friend a pony could ask for. unlike everypony else, he took things seriously, and.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_rarity!
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_ready.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_returned the blackboard you borrowed from cheerilee.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_so, as a show of unity.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_sometimes to feel good about yourself, you gotta let go of the past.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_special agent fluttershy, target detected below.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_step one, open the gate.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_that day.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_that way, when the time comes to let your greatness fly.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_the little guy got hungry in the night, so I gave him a snack but, i have no idea where these others came from.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_the tension is unbearable.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_they don't look scared to me.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_time to shake things up a little!
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_touch nose with tongue.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_twilight! mail's here!
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_uh, so?
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_uh, yeah. we were just heading to pick up some fresh pies.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_uh, yeah. we've totally got everything covered.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_wait, aren't the hatching grounds supposed to be hot?
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_wait, so you're not going to return the book?
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_why not a staircase that goes on forever?
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_with all these, jewels?
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_wouldn't it be easier to just fly?
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_ya know, whenever i'm feeling a little down it, it always helps if i do something with a friend.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_yeah, that must have been super relaxing.
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_you do?
Spike_Neutral_Very Noisy_you know, this would be an awful lot easier if there weren't two of us here getting under each other's feet.
Spike_Neutral__A book.
Spike_Neutral__A curse!
Spike_Neutral__A game of charades.
Spike_Neutral__A little dragon breath and fwoosh!
Spike_Neutral__A lot is changing and I, am getting older.
Spike_Neutral__About to call it a night?
Spike_Neutral__Absolutely!
Spike_Neutral__Absolutely. my home is in equestria with my friends.
Spike_Neutral__Actually i was orphaned as an egg and twilight raised me.
Spike_Neutral__Actually we're staying here.
Spike_Neutral__Actually, i'm pretty sure he ran As far away from here as possible.
Spike_Neutral__Actually, it's when.
Spike_Neutral__Ah! finally!
Spike_Neutral__Ah, thank goodness.
Spike_Neutral__Ahem.
Spike_Neutral__Ahhhhh.
Spike_Neutral__Alright! who's next?
Spike_Neutral__Although, that part is pretty cool.
Spike_Neutral__And I think i deserve it too.
Spike_Neutral__And I think this is the best trick so far.
Spike_Neutral__And I'll be number one.
Spike_Neutral__And any friend of spike the brave and glorious is a friend of the crystal empire, am i right?
Spike_Neutral__And before ponies discovered our beautiful land of equestria,.
Spike_Neutral__And by singing songs, which, of course, became the winter carols That we all still sing today.
Spike_Neutral__And feeling like the the hugest failure ever.
Spike_Neutral__And give every dragon you see on the way a hug.
Spike_Neutral__And i don't wanna overdo it.
Spike_Neutral__And i plan to keep it that way.
Spike_Neutral__And i've got the perfect treat!
Spike_Neutral__And it was the one thing cadance asked of me.
Spike_Neutral__And look at you now.
Spike_Neutral__And neither am i.
Spike_Neutral__And no pony was too happy about that.
Spike_Neutral__And now he's crying.
Spike_Neutral__And pick up treats.
Spike_Neutral__And so it came to pass, the magician and black knight, Vowed to rid spiketopia of the evil squizard.
Spike_Neutral__And so the paradise the ponies had found was soon lost.
Spike_Neutral__And sombra won't be coming back.
Spike_Neutral__And steal the electro orb, so she can use it to power up her doomsday device!
Spike_Neutral__And thank you.
Spike_Neutral__And that's, my fair share.
Spike_Neutral__And the only way i'm gonna do that, is to join the dragon migration!
Spike_Neutral__And this is going to be a royal crystalling, So pretty much the whole empire will show up.
Spike_Neutral__And together, they named their new land.
Spike_Neutral__And what prompted the ponies to clash?
Spike_Neutral__And when Twilight discovers it shredded up on her floor.
Spike_Neutral__And when all the planning and grand gestures go wrong, it reminds you the most romantic things.
Spike_Neutral__And who are you? And what are you?
Spike_Neutral__And you know how i get when i'm in the embroidery zone.
Spike_Neutral__And you're here and, not holed up in your cottage.
Spike_Neutral__And you, search that way!
Spike_Neutral__And, Owlowiscious.
Spike_Neutral__And, bonus, i can do it with my fire breath.
Spike_Neutral__And, he's planning a big romantic hearts and hooves dinner.
Spike_Neutral__And, here comes the best part.
Spike_Neutral__And, they could be anywhere.
Spike_Neutral__And, we have sundown. repeat, we have sundown.
Spike_Neutral__And?
Spike_Neutral__Another reason why i shouldn't compete.
Spike_Neutral__Any one of these tricks, even the teeniest, would be enough to show up Trixie.
Spike_Neutral__Are you all right?
Spike_Neutral__Are you kidding?
Spike_Neutral__Are you kidding?
Spike_Neutral__Are you sure you put them in the right spots?
Spike_Neutral__Are you talking to, yourself?
Spike_Neutral__As hard as it's gonna be for me to part with these little guys.
Spike_Neutral__As you wish.
Spike_Neutral__At least the statue's okay.
Spike_Neutral__Aw, come on. you act tough, but deep down, You're a softie.
Spike_Neutral__Aw, no way. That honor goes to Twilight here.
Spike_Neutral__Aw, shoot.
Spike_Neutral__Awkward.
Spike_Neutral__Bad news.
Spike_Neutral__Because, even if you don't believe you can do this, we do.
Spike_Neutral__Because, now he can't bother us cause he's off somewhere By himself all alone.
Spike_Neutral__Because, she'll already be here!
Spike_Neutral__Before they see each other.
Spike_Neutral__Besides.
Spike_Neutral__Big mac's character is sir mcbiggun.
Spike_Neutral__Breathed a scorching flame from his snout.
Spike_Neutral__But do you know what would be glorious?
Spike_Neutral__But i know you'll protect them, just as well as i would have.
Spike_Neutral__But i think she'll like it.
Spike_Neutral__But i think that makes this all the more special.
Spike_Neutral__But i thought your dad said.
Spike_Neutral__But it's not like anything bad happened.
Spike_Neutral__But look at big mac's face and tell me you don't believe in love.
Spike_Neutral__But look!
Spike_Neutral__But that's just an old ponies' tale.
Spike_Neutral__But that's just an old pony's tale.
Spike_Neutral__But this is your first lesson as her pupil.

Spike_Neutral__I listened to that pony drone on about gems For forty five minutes, so twilight wouldn't have to!
Spike_Neutral__I love you dear, my sweet sweet rari.
Spike_Neutral__I love you with the utmost clarity.
Spike_Neutral__I mean i like grass just fine, But would it hurt anybody to offer some gemstones?
Spike_Neutral__I mean the whole game coming to life Was completely terrifying.
Spike_Neutral__I mean, gross!
Spike_Neutral__I mean, princess twilight doesn't think that seems fair.
Spike_Neutral__I mean, there i was.
Spike_Neutral__I might know somepony who can help.
Spike_Neutral__I moved a polo match away from the tower so she could sleep!
Spike_Neutral__I need to learn what it means to be a dragon.
Spike_Neutral__I never should have been so jealous.
Spike_Neutral__I owe you a life debt and must serve you.
Spike_Neutral__I speak for the princess.
Spike_Neutral__I take it back.
Spike_Neutral__I think we have to try another restaurant.
Spike_Neutral__I think you're right, Twilight. I should take my comics to Canterlot.
Spike_Neutral__I thought i had too many deep fried gems.
Spike_Neutral__I thought we'd all be ruling Equestria together.
Spike_Neutral__I thought you banished him from the school?
Spike_Neutral__I thought your name was Owlowiscious?
Spike_Neutral__I was just doing this to protect the ponies.
Spike_Neutral__I'll get the food. How long will it take you to place all the apples?
Spike_Neutral__I'll go.
Spike_Neutral__I'll show you the splendors of hearts and hooves day in ponyville.
Spike_Neutral__I'm garbunkle, a famous magician.
Spike_Neutral__I'm impressed.
Spike_Neutral__I'm not gonna eat it!
Spike_Neutral__I'm ready when you are.
Spike_Neutral__I'm spike.
Spike_Neutral__I'm sure Twilight has told you all about me.
Spike_Neutral__I'm sure she'd want to hear what you have to say.
Spike_Neutral__I'm sure you understand.
Spike_Neutral__I'm the most romantic dragon I know.
Spike_Neutral__I'm waiting.
Spike_Neutral__I'm.
Spike_Neutral__If that's your problem, you've come to the right place.
Spike_Neutral__If we shut it down.
Spike_Neutral__If you don't want to play with us, you can I don't know, sit and watch.
Spike_Neutral__If you need some pointers let me know.
Spike_Neutral__If you were a hopeless romantic you'd know that was the only logical choice.
Spike_Neutral__In a world where evil reigns supreme, A small band of warriors stands tall Against the darkness.
Spike_Neutral__In retrospect, dragon flame and baked goods aren't the best combo.
Spike_Neutral__Is that like something you do?
Spike_Neutral__Is that new?
Spike_Neutral__Isn't that what you're doing?
Spike_Neutral__Isn't that, rainbow dash?
Spike_Neutral__It isn't magical or anything like the call of the dragon lord.
Spike_Neutral__It looked pretty real though, didn't it?
Spike_Neutral__It might be a good reminder to have around.
Spike_Neutral__It seemed simple when it started.
Spike_Neutral__It was my idea to bake the invitation inside.
Spike_Neutral__It would mean even more to see you happy.
Spike_Neutral__It'll be hard to do that without friends.
Spike_Neutral__It's a dragonsneeze tree.
Spike_Neutral__It's a stone scale.
Spike_Neutral__It's an afternoon.
Spike_Neutral__It's from shining armor.
Spike_Neutral__It's green.
Spike_Neutral__It's kinda like our tradition.
Spike_Neutral__It's like being on vacation!
Spike_Neutral__It's madame pinkie's place.
Spike_Neutral__It's not every day the princesses pass all their responsibilities on to your and your friends.
Spike_Neutral__It's not the same thing, Twilight.
Spike_Neutral__It's ok guys. they're with me.
Spike_Neutral__It's over here.
Spike_Neutral__It's the only way to protect equestria from the dragons.
Spike_Neutral__It's true, I was there.
Spike_Neutral__Just a little nibble? Come on!
Spike_Neutral__Just uh, wanted to make sure you're ready For your big ceremony today.
Spike_Neutral__Let's see. There's, there's fluttershy.
Spike_Neutral__Look at the wall.
Spike_Neutral__Look! Starswirl's so stressed, he's already going grey!
Spike_Neutral__Lookin' good.
Spike_Neutral__Lyra heartstrings, and moon dancer.
Spike_Neutral__Making peace between Abyssinians and the Diamond Dogs has not been easy.
Spike_Neutral__Maybe I can help you.
Spike_Neutral__Maybe I could take some of these off your hooves?
Spike_Neutral__Maybe if I had a mustache and a beard.
Spike_Neutral__Maybe next time, ease in with those truth bombs?
Spike_Neutral__Maybe not that.
Spike_Neutral__Maybe we're finished was about the day.
Spike_Neutral__Maybe you should talk to them. I bet they're feeling the same way.
Spike_Neutral__Maybe, there is.
Spike_Neutral__Missing something deep down and dragonish.
Spike_Neutral__Most things in the crystal empire aren't.
Spike_Neutral__Movin' on.
Spike_Neutral__Nice use of number sixteen.
Spike_Neutral__No harm in that.
Spike_Neutral__No other pony has to hear a word about it?
Spike_Neutral__No reason.
Spike_Neutral__No you haven't.
Spike_Neutral__No, next to him.
Spike_Neutral__No, think about it.
Spike_Neutral__No.
Spike_Neutral__No. nope.
Spike_Neutral__No?
Spike_Neutral__No? ok.
Spike_Neutral__Nopony does.
Spike_Neutral__Not many places to hide.
Spike_Neutral__Not on my watch.
Spike_Neutral__Not really, no.
Spike_Neutral__Now i finally have a chance to see how i'm supposed to be.
Spike_Neutral__Now?
Spike_Neutral__Number one.
Spike_Neutral__Of course Big Mac asked me to help with his proposal.
Spike_Neutral__Of course i will.
Spike_Neutral__Of course! wouldn't have agreed to it if i couldn't.
Spike_Neutral__Ogres and obliettes is a fantasy role playing adventure game.
Spike_Neutral__Ogres and oubliettes?
Spike_Neutral__Oh don't worry, It doesn't have to be a long essay.
Spike_Neutral__Oh yeah, the ketchup.
Spike_Neutral__Oh, I don't know. It's not every day the princesses that have ruled Equestria for hundreds of moons retire and.
Spike_Neutral__Oh, bad idea. the guard gets mad.
Spike_Neutral__Oh, hey.
Spike_Neutral__Oh, i guess so.
Spike_Neutral__Oh, i know! maybe sugar belle has a wacky cousin who's never been on his own and she has to leave him in charge of her shop while she apprentices with missus cake.
Spike_Neutral__Oh, it's kind of important.
Spike_Neutral__Oh, lady rarity, my damsel in distress.
Spike_Neutral__Oh, okay.
Spike_Neutral__Oh, okay. let's see.
Spike_Neutral__Oh, please! you're the most studious student ever.
Spike_Neutral__Oh, sorry.
Spike_Neutral__Oh, uh, well, they are changelings so they can, change.
Spike_Neutral__Oh, you know, just settin' 'em up and knockin' 'em down!
Spike_Neutral__Oh. hey. you guys aren't fighting?
Spike_Neutral__Oh. i thought maybe you'd decided to come out with us tonight.
Spike_Neutral__Oh. you're still on that?
Spike_Neutral__Ok then. i'm gonna need backup.
Spike_Neutral__Ok, rock, how do i know you're really a rock?
Spike_Neutral__Okay, You finish your table, I'll pick up whatever you need to eat.
Spike_Neutral__Okay, maybe not that exciting.
Spike_Neutral__Okay. so maybe i did get a little carried away making decisions.
Spike_Neutral__On the twenty first day of.
Spike_Neutral__Once upon a time, before celestia.
Spike_Neutral__One castle of friendship, check!
Spike_Neutral__Or maybe a goatee.
Spike_Neutral__Or we woulda forgot to celebrate!
Spike_Neutral__Perfect.
Spike_Neutral__Perfectly understandable.
Spike_Neutral__Phoenixes aren't meant to be domesticated.
Spike_Neutral__Piece of cake.
Spike_Neutral__Plus starswirl the bearded, to do it.
Spike_Neutral__Poof!
Spike_Neutral__Preci.
Spike_Neutral__Princess twilight will be rested, Princess cadance will be proud, And, princess spike deserves a little reward.
Spike_Neutral__Probably not.
Spike_Neutral__Raising the sun every morning was so hard.
Spike_Neutral__Rarity fell way behind.
Spike_Neutral__Rarity.
Spike_Neutral__Rarity?
Spike_Neutral__Ready.
Spike_Neutral__Really Twilight, we don't have to bring the comic. I'm not even sure how much longer I'll collect them.
Spike_Neutral__Really?
Spike_Neutral__Really?
Spike_Neutral__Right now, most of equestria doesn't even know we're doing a onesversary play.
Spike_Neutral__Right. check!
Spike_Neutral__Right?
Spike_Neutral__She could just stop herself from falling Into a pit of lava.
Spike_Neutral__She makes it look so easy.
Spike_Neutral__She'll be a while. man, this place looks terrible!
Spike_Neutral__She's in her castle.
Spike_Neutral__She's unbearable!
Spike_Neutral__Shh!
Spike_Neutral__Shh!
Spike_Neutral__Shining armor definitely won't expect that.
Spike_Neutral__Sludge was just a great big phony.
Spike_Neutral__So it's up to me to come through for her in her time of need!
Spike_Neutral__So lifelike.
Spike_Neutral__So that puppeteer didn't like your exquisitely crafted best puppet theater in the history of puppeteers and puppet theater.
Spike_Neutral__So the messages that were in the desserts.
Spike_Neutral__So the ponies here think i'm some kind of hero, huh?
Spike_Neutral__So uh, big mac and i were wondering.
Spike_Neutral__So what's the good news?
Spike_Neutral__So, how can, princess twilight be of service?
Spike_Neutral__So, it is possible to vanquish an ursa major all by yourself?
Spike_Neutral__So, we should cover as much ground as possible.
Spike_Neutral__So, what if you stayed out a little longer with your friends?
Spike_Neutral__So, what's the emergency?
Spike_Neutral__So, you freakin' out yet?
Spike_Neutral__Some things just can't be explained.
Spike_Neutral__Sometimes talking to a good friend is all it takes.
Spike_Neutral__Sorry, future spike.
Spike_Neutral__Sounds good to me.
Spike_Neutral__Spike? the brave and glorious? i'm sure you've heard of me.
Spike_Neutral__Spill it! Every detail!
Spike_Neutral__Starlight is supposed to come over soon.
Spike_Neutral__Step three, walk away.
Spike_Neutral__Sweet apple acres.
Spike_Neutral__Technically speaking, you already are out right now.
Spike_Neutral__Than to eat it myself.
Spike_Neutral__Thank you smolder. my turn.
Spike_Neutral__Thank you.
Spike_Neutral__Thanks but, I already read this one. I don't need to take it to Canterlot.
Spike_Neutral__Thanks, Twilight. You know I'll always be your right hoof dragon.
Spike_Neutral__That bird could use a little color.
Spike_Neutral__That does sound perfect.
Spike_Neutral__That hasn't happened in a millenia!
Spike_Neutral__That is dragon culture.
Spike_Neutral__That is the most ridiculous thing i've ever heard!
Spike_Neutral__That it took five unicorn sorcerers.
Spike_Neutral__That probably made things worse.
Spike_Neutral__That sounds like the worst night ever.
Spike_Neutral__That thing is packed. c'mon, what've you got to lose?
Spike_Neutral__That was a total bust.
Spike_Neutral__That would be from the royal crystalling.
Spike_Neutral__That's a big risk.
Spike_Neutral__That's a relief.
Spike_Neutral__That's because you raised me.
Spike_Neutral__That's easy for you to say.
Spike_Neutral__That's new.
Spike_Neutral__That's nice.
Spike_Neutral__That's right. uh, now go start your long journey home.
Spike_Neutral__That's the thing.
Spike_Neutral__That's why i came to find you.
Spike_Neutral__That's why she won't need you to come to her village anymore.
Spike_Neutral__That's, finished. cause it's today.
Spike_Neutral__The bars exist.
Spike_Neutral__The celebration isn't until the day after tomorrow.
Spike_Neutral__The dragon lord wants my advice.
Spike_Neutral__The guard laughs.
Spike_Neutral__The more creatures who know about friendship, the safer we'll be.
Spike_Neutral__The parents bring it before the crystal heart.
Spike_Neutral__The proof is in the pudding.
Spike_Neutral__The school is still unaccredited.
Spike_Neutral__The simplest acting exercise they could think of.
Spike_Neutral__The spell backfires.
Spike_Neutral__The squizard has laid siege to the last free city In spiketopia.
Spike_Neutral__The whole point of the game is you get to use Your imagination and be someone you're not.
Spike_Neutral__Then i roll this twenty sided die to see if you're successful.
Spike_Neutral__Then you can help me.
Spike_Neutral__There it is.
Spike_Neutral__There's a little something we wanted to give you before we leave.
Spike_Neutral__There's archers, mages, rogues.
Spike_Neutral__There's only one thing to do, and only i can do it.
Spike_Neutral__There's, one two three four.
Spike_Neutral__These are your friends.
Spike_Neutral__They are new.
Spike_Neutral__They don't need all that stuff, they'll be fine.
Spike_Neutral__They get the purest shard of crystal they can find.
Spike_Neutral__They're cool.
Spike_Neutral__They're my friends.
Spike_Neutral__They're not the only ones.
Spike_Neutral__This can!
Spike_Neutral__This won't end well.
Spike_Neutral__Three of us would be way better than two.
Spike_Neutral__To be honest I tasted some, and burning them might have been an improvement.
Spike_Neutral__Too bad we can't do anything about the rainstorm.
Spike_Neutral__Too bad you're busy.
Spike_Neutral__Too soon?
Spike_Neutral__Try again, twi. you can do it.
Spike_Neutral__Trying to light the torch with all of equestria watching.
Spike_Neutral__Turns out he wasn't what a real dragon should be after all.
Spike_Neutral__Twice.
Spike_Neutral__Twilight flopple!
Spike_Neutral__Twilight seems to think i don't have a chance with her, But, eh, what does she know?
Spike_Neutral__Twitchy tail?
Spike_Neutral__Two more minutes, twilight. i'm just getting to the good part.
Spike_Neutral__Uh huh.
Spike_Neutral__Uh huh.
Spike_Neutral__Uh huh.
Spike_Neutral__Uh yeah uh.
Spike_Neutral__Uh, I think they did okay without us.
Spike_Neutral__Uh, I'm pretty sure that's everything.
Spike_Neutral__Uh, Spike you know, assistant number one?
Spike_Neutral__Uh, i'm talking about a real game.
Spike_Neutral__Uh, it's not too late to forget i opened my big mouth.
Spike_Neutral__Uh, sorry.
Spike_Neutral__Uh, twilight.
Spike_Neutral__Uh, twilight?
Spike_Neutral__Uh, what's hibernation?
Spike_Neutral__Uh, yeah.
Spike_Neutral__Uh, yes, wonderful.
Spike_Neutral__Uh, yes?
Spike_Neutral__Uhh, I don't know Twilight.
Spike_Neutral__Um, twilight?
Spike_Neutral__Unlike Twilight, who.
Spike_Neutral__Wait for your favorite dragon!
Spike_Neutral__Wait! um, we were wondering, what are you up to tonight?
Spike_Neutral__Wanna do it again rainbow dash?
Spike_Neutral__Want one?
Spike_Neutral__We believe in you. In us.
Spike_Neutral__We can't hear you.
Spike_Neutral__We can't leave the Power Ponies behind.
Spike_Neutral__We can't put on a front and pretend not to love, It's impossible.
Spike_Neutral__We could still fit in a quick trip to ponyville and be back in plenty of time To finish off these last few things before the main event.
Spike_Neutral__We find ourselves trapped in the dungeon Of the evil squizard. the bars are locked tight.
Spike_Neutral__We just saw sugar belle.
Spike_Neutral__We should give him another chance.
Spike_Neutral__We traveled back in time to when rainbow dash raced the bullies Who made fun of fluttershy and Performed her first sonic rainboom?
Spike_Neutral__We want to play our game.
Spike_Neutral__We wanted to give this to you before you left Ponyville but, things got a little hectic.
Spike_Neutral__We're here to rehearse a new day in equestria!
Spike_Neutral__We're just.
Spike_Neutral__Well that doesn't seem fair.
Spike_Neutral__Well you can do whatever you want.
Spike_Neutral__Well you're good at a lot of things. just not nest making, ice skating, animal waking, snow clearing.
Spike_Neutral__Well, actually, this is my first birthday in ponyville.
Spike_Neutral__Well, at least you don't have to worry about them Talking over each other.
Spike_Neutral__Well, i guess i can return it, now that the fair's over.
Spike_Neutral__Well, if that was an ursa minor.
Spike_Neutral__Well, if you were, it'd be.
Spike_Neutral__Well, it's just how i feel.
Spike_Neutral__Well, maybe i happened to mention it to him.
Spike_Neutral__Well, nopony's perfect.
Spike_Neutral__Well, pies really are sugar belle's thing.
Spike_Neutral__Well, should we pack up?
Spike_Neutral__Well, this dragon does.
Spike_Neutral__Well, what do you know.
Spike_Neutral__Well, you're half right.
Spike_Neutral__Well.
Spike_Neutral__What class are you, captain wuzz?
Spike_Neutral__What do you mean?
Spike_Neutral__What i should have done in the first place.
Spike_Neutral__What if i told you, there was somepony they respect and admire So much.
Spike_Neutral__What if we forgot the board and the pieces for a minute?
Spike_Neutral__What if you toned it down just a teensy bit?
Spike_Neutral__What is?
Spike_Neutral__What's that you said, gummy?
Spike_Neutral__What's that?
Spike_Neutral__What's that?
Spike_Neutral__What's wrong, twilight?
Spike_Neutral__What?
Spike_Neutral__What?
Spike_Neutral__What? i didn't think she meant alone alone.
Spike_Neutral__What? oh no.
Spike_Neutral__When his king aligned himself with the squizard, Sir mcbiggun would not besmirch his honor.
Spike_Neutral__When my friends really need me i do come through!
Spike_Neutral__When she can't find you, she'll realize how much she misses you.
Spike_Neutral__Whenever a baby is born in the crystal empire.
Spike_Neutral__Where are you going to send her?
Spike_Neutral__Whew.
Spike_Neutral__Which one?
Spike_Neutral__Who does that, like, two days a week. no, no, three.
Spike_Neutral__Who wouldn't? fluttershy told us you practically Begged her to stay, and then at the train station, You were just standing there, all alone.
Spike_Neutral__Whoa.
Spike_Neutral__Whoa.
Spike_Neutral__Why don't we just cancel the show?
Spike_Neutral__Why don't you ask her?
Spike_Neutral__Why would i be upset to discover that i can light fire.
Spike_Neutral__Why would she come here?
Spike_Neutral__Why would she.
Spike_Neutral__Why? is that bad?
Spike_Neutral__Yeah i'm just gonna grab some ice cream for us and catch up.
Spike_Neutral__Yeah well, we're like this now.
Spike_Neutral__Yeah! Since we all know that Twilight here is.
Spike_Neutral__Yeah, about that.
Spike_Neutral__Yeah, i'm a sweet-talker.
Spike_Neutral__Yeah, it does.
Spike_Neutral__Yeah, knock on wood.
Spike_Neutral__Yeah, that's how i felt too.
Spike_Neutral__Yeah, what she said.
Spike_Neutral__Yeah, when did that happen exactly?
Spike_Neutral__Yep. get ready for all your dreams to come true.
Spike_Neutral__Yes, ma'am.
Spike_Neutral__Yes, you are! You're better than her.
Spike_Neutral__You aren't feeling any molt effects are you?
Spike_Neutral__You can just contribute something else to the foal and filly fair.
Spike_Neutral__You don't have to ask.
Spike_Neutral__You don't look so good.
Spike_Neutral__You fly me up there and i'll help you look out For boulders, like a second set of eyes!
Spike_Neutral__You got it!
Spike_Neutral__You have to roll a seventeen or higher to succeed.
Spike_Neutral__You know since owls eat, you know, mice.
Spike_Neutral__You know what i do when i have a problem too big to solve?
Spike_Neutral__You know what?
Spike_Neutral__You know, i can go if you two don't want to.
Spike_Neutral__You know, something really worthy of the crystal empire's admiration?
Spike_Neutral__You know, uh, if you're nervous about Your friendship lessons, it's totally okay to say so.
Spike_Neutral__You mean day?
Spike_Neutral__You need eleven intelligent points to cast a transform into root vegetable spell.
Spike_Neutral__You should ask applejack if she wants you to get all the apple family carts a makeover.
Spike_Neutral__You should forgive your friend.
Spike_Neutral__You surprised her.
Spike_Neutral__You think they know we're here?
Spike_Neutral__You tied!
Spike_Neutral__You'd be using your magic to stand up for your friends.
Spike_Neutral__You'll come up with something. We can't save Equestria without you.
Spike_Neutral__You'll love it once we get started.
Spike_Neutral__You're new to the world of education, aren't you?
Spike_Neutral__You're not gonna be sent back to magic kindergarten.
Spike_Neutral__You're not mommy.
Spike_Neutral__You're not still worried about ruling Equestria, are you?
Spike_Neutral__You're the masked matter horn!
Spike_Neutral__You've been changing things, but you haven't been making them better.
Spike_Neutral__You've been so anxious all day that you've completely forgot about the picnic.
Spike_Neutral__You've heard of hoity toity?
Spike_Neutral__You, search that way!
Spike_Neutral__Your friend took your seat?
Spike_Neutral__a level twenty seven Black knight unicorn from castle chadwick.
Spike_Neutral__all the praise in the world means nothing if you don't feel it inside.
Spike_Neutral__and Discord will put all the apples in place.
Spike_Neutral__and helped keep celestia out of the castle hallways.
Spike_Neutral__and i am one hundred percent sure I can get the whole crystal empire to be your friend too.
Spike_Neutral__and make sure we stuck to twilight's plan, so we'd all get to the throne room at the same time.
Spike_Neutral__and she probably had something else on her schedule.
Spike_Neutral__are usually the simplest.
Spike_Neutral__comfort blanket.
Spike_Neutral__cordially extends an invitation, To twilight sparkle plus one guest.
Spike_Neutral__crystal er, hoof!
Spike_Neutral__green with envy. well, in your case, pink with envy.
Spike_Neutral__hear ye, hear ye.
Spike_Neutral__her grand royal highness, princess celestia of equestria.
Spike_Neutral__how about an archer?
Spike_Neutral__i don't want anypony else to see this.
Spike_Neutral__i knew shining armor would let it play out until the last possible second.
Spike_Neutral__i'll be fine.
Spike_Neutral__i've gotta help them.
Spike_Neutral__is pleased to announce the grand galloping gala, to be held in the magnificent capital city of canterlot.
Spike_Neutral__it's better this way, right?
Spike_Neutral__just, two small problems.
Spike_Neutral__luna and i struck a deal.
Spike_Neutral__maybe we should just wait here.
Spike_Neutral__no matter how many times others tell you you're great.
Spike_Neutral__no problem, i'll stay here and finish this comfort blanket.
Spike_Neutral__oh. you mean to find first folio.
Spike_Neutral__once luna was on board, i just had to do my part.
Spike_Neutral__pass all their responsibilities on to your and your friends.
Spike_Neutral__places, everypony.

Spike_Neutral__please?
Spike_Neutral__see? i told you he'd be impressed.
Spike_Neutral__she put zephyr in charge of the catacombs.
Spike_Neutral__sir mcbiggun, are you prepared to enter the world Of ogres and oubliettes?
Spike_Neutral__smell my dirty feet.
Spike_Neutral__so, while shining armor went on and on about all his improved security measures.
Spike_Neutral__sometimes just hearing what someone appreciates about you, can make you feel better about yourself.
Spike_Neutral__starlight and sunburst got over their past and rekindled their friendship.
Spike_Neutral__sure we do.
Spike_Neutral__technically, she's more of a student than a protégé.
Spike_Neutral__that's the name of the land.
Spike_Neutral__the Energy it uses to protect the crystal empire i guess.
Spike_Neutral__the spellbook!
Spike_Neutral__then, while everyone was distracted by his gloating.
Spike_Neutral__this is, ogres and oubliettes.
Spike_Neutral__today i learned how important it is to be honest with your friends.
Spike_Neutral__twenty moons from now?
Spike_Neutral__well, That's just what friends do.
Spike_Neutral__what? did you find it?
Spike_Neutral__when did you learn to do that?
Spike_Neutral__when they're doing something that you don't think is right.
Spike_Neutral__wow, talk about a party pooper.
Spike_Neutral__yada yada yada.
Spike_Neutral__yep!
Spike_Neutral__you've already done the work for starlight's Lesson with this list, all we have to do is follow it!
Spike_Sad Annoyed_Very Noisy_i'm the one who said all we needed was this list.
Spike_Sad Anxious_Noisy_And it's all my fault!
Spike_Sad Anxious_Noisy_I can't believe i thought somepony like that.
Spike_Sad Anxious_Noisy_I should have told my two friends about each other immediately.
Spike_Sad Anxious_Noisy_I was so worried about how it could go wrong, I didn't even think about how it could go right.
Spike_Sad Anxious_Noisy_I'm the one who's sorry.
Spike_Sad Anxious_Noisy_Instead of assuming they wouldn't get along.
Spike_Sad Anxious_Noisy_What have i done?
Spike_Sad Anxious_Noisy_You were just worried about me and i lost my temper.
Spike_Sad Anxious__My title of equestria's friendship ambassador is a lie!
Spike_Sad Anxious__Oh no.
Spike_Sad Shouting__Why!?
Spike_Sad Shouting__Why!?
Spike_Sad_Noisy_A fear that will never come to pass. i'm never gonna send you away.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_Almost all of us have superpowers.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_And I'm cold, hungry, tired, and lonely.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_And i'm small, and meek, and i like to wear aprons.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_And once i do.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_But instead, i let you become something awful.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_But, they never really thought of me that way.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_Can you forgive me?
Spike_Sad_Noisy_Could it get any worse?
Spike_Sad_Noisy_Ergo, the packing.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_He's pretty much useless.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_Hey class.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_Hey there, not handsome.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_How come i don't get a ticket to the gala?
Spike_Sad_Noisy_I can forget rarity thinking of me as a friend at all.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_I can forget rarity thinking of me as the most supportive friend.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_I deserve it.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_I didn't take these silly things out, or fluff this like i was supposed to.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_I guess i got a little carried away.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_I guess i know what that feels like.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_I guess i was just, enjoying feeling like a, princess.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_I just saw what needed to be done and reacted.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_I know it should make me feel safer but.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_I miss the real pinkie.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_I need to be alone right now.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_I think they're gone.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_I used my friend's position, to make myself feel good.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_I will miss you, my sweets.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_I'll, catch up with you.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_I'm a sad little dragon, with nothing to.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_I'm sorry!
Spike_Sad_Noisy_I-it just felt so good to have ponies Caring about my opinions on such important matters.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_Isn't there, anything i can help you with, twilight?
Spike_Sad_Noisy_It's, been an honor, being your, faithful assistant.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_Of course it's weird that she meant me, her and the spellbook.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_Okay, fine. i'll come.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_Okay.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_She doesn't love me anymore.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_She.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_Sorry, pinkie.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_Sorry.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_The bars are locked, and oh who am i kidding?
Spike_Sad_Noisy_They probably never want to see me again.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_This cake was gonna be so good.

Spike_Sad_Noisy_Yeah, me too.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_You don't like it.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_You guys should be mad at me.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_You should probably ask somebody special instead.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_You were home, and you told me you didn't need me anymore. you were sending me away.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_You're right, shining armor. sorry. that was a, bad joke.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_and you cheer up garble, at least he listens to you.

Spike_Sad_Noisy_until i, Didn't anymore.
Spike_Sad_Noisy_why don't i see what i can do about the eggs.
Spike_Sad_Very Noisy_And all i could think about was myself.
Spike_Sad_Very Noisy_Awww.
Spike_Sad_Very Noisy_But she doesn't love me anymore.
Spike_Sad_Very Noisy_Even if my tummy's full.
Spike_Sad_Very Noisy_Guess i'll just stand back here doing nothing.
Spike_Sad_Very Noisy_I can't believe ember ditched me.
Spike_Sad_Very Noisy_I miss Twilight and the pony gang.
Spike_Sad_Very Noisy_I wonder if, dragons, cry.
Spike_Sad_Very Noisy_I'm looking at a complete stranger.
Spike_Sad_Very Noisy_It really, really does.
Spike_Sad_Very Noisy_No wonder my friends never need me to do anything important. They are the ones with the superpowers.
Spike_Sad_Very Noisy_So, I'm better off here, all by myself.
Spike_Sad_Very Noisy_Take it. just take it!
Spike_Sad_Very Noisy_The rest of me is still empty.
Spike_Sad_Very Noisy_They've probably already figured out how to escape.
Spike_Sad__A book.
Spike_Sad__And that you didn't love me anymore.
Spike_Sad__Any of you. just wanted the jewels.
Spike_Sad__Big mac's gonna need a miracle.
Spike_Sad__But i'm growing up.
Spike_Sad__But i, kinda feel less.
Spike_Sad__But it, won't be the same.
Spike_Sad__But when Discord insists on being involved.
Spike_Sad__But, instead of getting into the spirit of things like all of you.
Spike_Sad__Could show me how to be anything.
Spike_Sad__From twilight.
Spike_Sad__Guess you have better things to do.
Spike_Sad__He also wasn't my real dad.
Spike_Sad__Honestly, i thought having him around Would make me feel more dragonish.
Spike_Sad__I don't know.
Spike_Sad__I have no cake.
Spike_Sad__I have no jewels.
Spike_Sad__I hope you'll all forgive me someday.
Spike_Sad__I ignored you.
Spike_Sad__I just wanted everything to be perfect.
Spike_Sad__I just wish i had been one to you.
Spike_Sad__I know. but there's no other way to keep my friends safe.
Spike_Sad__I know. i'm so sorry.
Spike_Sad__I let everypony down, twice.
Spike_Sad__I mean, this was a big deal.
Spike_Sad__I should go.
Spike_Sad__I thought you didn't need me anymore.
Spike_Sad__I usually just get one present.
Spike_Sad__I wasn't really thinking about you at all.
Spike_Sad__I wish i could stop it, but i can't.
Spike_Sad__I'm pretty sure he doesn't want to see me.
Spike_Sad__I'm sorry twilight.
Spike_Sad__In front of.

Spitfire_Angry_Noisy_I hereby strip you of your wonderbolts status!
Spitfire_Angry_Noisy_Not any more. for attempting to frame rainbow dash.
Spitfire_Annoyed Shouting_Noisy_All of you!
Spitfire_Annoyed Shouting_Noisy_If you had what it took to be an elite flyer You'd already be a wonderbolt!
Spitfire_Annoyed Shouting_Noisy_Now!
Spitfire_Annoyed Shouting_Noisy_Rainbow dash!
Spitfire_Annoyed Shouting_Noisy_You don't!
Spitfire_Annoyed Shouting_Noisy_You're gonna find out it's pretty hard to stunt tricks.
Spitfire_Annoyed Shouting_Very Noisy_Still think you're something special?
Spitfire_Annoyed_Noisy_And?
Spitfire_Annoyed_Noisy_Do you want to tell me why one of my most promising students Is flying like a balloon with a hole in it?

Spitfire_Annoyed_Noisy_Well i'm here to tell you if you play that game.
Spitfire_Annoyed_Noisy_What is it rainbow dash?
Spitfire_Annoyed_Noisy_You gonna tell us what just happened, newbie?
Spitfire_Annoyed_Noisy_You're supposed to be up there busting clouds with your partner.
Spitfire_Annoyed_Very Noisy_How dare you storm out of my office without giving me a chance to respond!
Spitfire_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Quit yer whisperin' and give me five hundred laps!
Spitfire_Annoyed__I've drummed flyers out of the bolts for less.
Spitfire_Annoyed__Way to go, rainbow crash.
Spitfire_Annoyed__urgh!
Spitfire_Anxious_Noisy_I sure hope so.
Spitfire_Anxious_Noisy_I-i mean, she wasn't seen eating one.
Spitfire_Anxious_Noisy_What are you saying newbie?
Spitfire_Anxious_Very Noisy_Hey! look out!
Spitfire_Anxious_Very Noisy_Higher, crash! you're breaking formation!
Spitfire_Anxious_Very Noisy_There!
Spitfire_Anxious_Very Noisy_We've got turbulence!
Spitfire_Anxious__Or uh, negative.
Spitfire_Confused_Noisy_Are you sure that's the right decision?
Spitfire_Confused__All of them?
Spitfire_Happy_Noisy_I love my job.
Spitfire_Happy_Noisy_So you're the little pony who saved our lives. We really wanted to meet you, and say thanks.
Spitfire_Happy_Noisy_You're a leader.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_A little practice and you'll be beating records in no time.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Ah, don't be modest.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_All right, rainbow dash. let's see what you got.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Always hungry after a show, eh, soarin?
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_And i think lightning dust likes to push herself a little harder than you do.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_And the original crest with the wonderbolts motto on it.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_And when they do, A wonderbolt must be able to recover quickly.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_As soon as possible.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Being the best should never come at the expense of our fellow ponies.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Better get to it, crash.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_But i wouldn't go writin' home about it!
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_But judging from your time, it was obviously an effective tactic.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_But spinouts can still happen.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Come on, vapor trail. You're going to have to build up your endurance If you want a shot at the academy.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Definitely made the right decision making you two a team.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Do you understand?
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Excellent.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Explain your methods.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_For the rest of the camp, you'll be working in pairs.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Good choice, always stick with the winners.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Good training, everypony.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Got a problem with that?
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Hello ma'am, nice to meet you.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_I got this.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_I wouldn't have, if rainbow hadn't found me so fast!
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_I'm glad you're still here.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_I'm gonna go out there and, stunt! some, tricks!
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_I'm not sure why you're acting like this But you need to stop.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_If any pair splits apart, they will be immediately disqualified.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_It loooks like soarin's wing won't heal in time for the trials.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_It's about pushing ourselves in the right direction.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_It's not just about pushing ourselves.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Lead ponies and wing ponies must fly together.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Let me give you a different scenario.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Listen, i get it kid. i used to be like you.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Nice job, rainbow dash. You may not have set a new record, but you showed a lot of guts.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Nice work crash.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Not really, but it's not my job to worry About their relationships.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Now everypony, get on your marks!
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Now it's official. welcome to the wonderbolts, crash!
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Now, who's first?
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Of course you're supposed to be a wonderbolt!
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Okay, go!
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Okay. you asked for it.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Once you have recovered, you must come in for a smooth landing.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Or today. how'd you like wind rider's spot in the show?
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Rainbow dash, you are something.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Ready to fly?
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Right. and i know you've seen the academy bunks.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Saw that at the academy, seeing it again here.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_She just might beat your record!
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_She's one of our most promising reserves.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Six point five seconds. not bad.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_So that means you could fly with us.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_That cloud barely knew you were there!
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_That has only happened once.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_That's why i made her lead pony, got it?
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_The others seem to have had a little trouble With the precision part of the exercise. I'd better go help sort them out.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_The wonderbolts are looking for the best flyers in equestria.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_The wonderbolts are the fastest, best precision flyers in the world.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Then let's go!
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_These two have a lot of potential.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_This better be important.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_This is for training purposes.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_This is not recess.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Today we'll be doing our famous air obstacle course.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Today you will all be participating in the flag hunt.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Tomorrow morning i'll post the teams Including who'll be lead pony, and who'll be wing pony.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Want to come hang out with us?
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_We can learn a lot from a competitor like you.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_We put you through some pretty intense workouts at the wonderbolt academy and you handled those just fine.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_We want you to fly with us.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_We'll divide you into two teams.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Well then, let me be the first to tell you.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Well then, now's your chance.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Well, things are gonna be pretty shady indeed.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Well, we have been getting mysterious Monthly pie donations.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_What about you?
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_What are you doing back so soon?
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_What's that?
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Whatever you did, it worked.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_When you can't go out in the sun.
Spitfire_Neutral_Noisy_Who knows? they might even be better than you, crash.

Spitfire_Neutral_Very Noisy_Take some time to think about it.
Spitfire_Neutral_Very Noisy_Team briefings are every morning at.
Spitfire_Neutral_Very Noisy_That's why i made her lead pony.
Spitfire_Neutral_Very Noisy_The object of this exercise is to work on your precision flying Under extreme circumstances.
Spitfire_Neutral_Very Noisy_They will be. and most of the wonderbolts Like to make a flashy entrance, so stay alert.
Spitfire_Neutral_Very Noisy_This, is the dizzitron.
Spitfire_Neutral_Very Noisy_We better get some shut eye before practice.
Spitfire_Neutral_Very Noisy_Welcome, princess twilight.
Spitfire_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, let me tell you, you don't!
Spitfire_Neutral_Very Noisy_Whoa, since when did we add fireworks to the show?
Spitfire_Neutral_Very Noisy_Why don't you two go hit the mess hall early?
Spitfire_Neutral_Very Noisy_Wind rider, i see you met rainbow dash!
Spitfire_Neutral_Very Noisy_Yeah. it's everypony's least favorite part of trial week.
Spitfire_Neutral_Very Noisy_You have your work cut out for you.
Spitfire_Neutral_Very Noisy_You'll be judged on your speed, strength, agility And technique, culminating in a final evaluation.
Spitfire_Neutral_Very Noisy_You've got a minute?
Spitfire_Neutral_Very Noisy_i'm here to make them elite fliers.
Spitfire_Neutral__A bit excessive for cloud busting.
Spitfire_Neutral__Affirmative.
Spitfire_Neutral__All right wonderbolts, let's hit the showers And give rainbow dash some, time to spend with her family.
Spitfire_Neutral__And don't worry about winning. it's not a race.
Spitfire_Neutral__Are we under investigation?
Spitfire_Neutral__As good as any wonderbolt.
Spitfire_Neutral__Because i believe you and lightning dust will be an unstoppable team.
Spitfire_Neutral__But it has to be done.
Spitfire_Neutral__But just focus on the routine for now, ok?
Spitfire_Neutral__Do you not think you'll be an unstoppable team?
Spitfire_Neutral__Fifteen seconds. decent.
Spitfire_Neutral__Good luck.

Spitfire_Neutral__Like worst flier of the day Has to clean up the whole compound.
Spitfire_Neutral__Look Rainbow Dash, I know this is important to you, and we all want the routine to be special.
Spitfire_Neutral__Looks like your skills saved us again.
Spitfire_Neutral__Maybe this will help motivate you.
Spitfire_Neutral__Never should've lied and tried to replace you to begin with.
Spitfire_Neutral__Not anymore, kid.
Spitfire_Neutral__Not quite. i know you've been a reservist for a while, But the bolts have a few of their own rules You might not know about.
Spitfire_Neutral__Ok newbie, we've got a show in two days, Which means you've gotta hustle your haunches To learn this routine.
Spitfire_Neutral__Okay, lightning dust, you're up.
Spitfire_Neutral__Rainbow dash, glad we found you.
Spitfire_Neutral__Rainbow dash, over here.
Spitfire_Neutral__That's not how it works around here.
Spitfire_Neutral__Then what's the problem?
Spitfire_Neutral__Wanna be our third?
Spitfire_Neutral__We all have our nicknames on our jackets. right, clipper?
Spitfire_Neutral__We need you in the show when we get to ponyville.
Spitfire_Neutral__We've been waiting for a spot to open up Ever since you joined the reserves.
Spitfire_Neutral__Well, Dash or no Dash, Twilight's about to get that crown.
Spitfire_Neutral__Well, rainbow dash.
Spitfire_Neutral__What do you say?
Spitfire_Neutral__Yeah. i do.
Spitfire_Neutral__You don't want to know what they call me.
Spitfire_Neutral__You really added that sparkle to that pressure diamond drop.
Spitfire_Neutral__You sure about that?
Spitfire_Neutral__You're the pony that saved us in cloudsdale and won the best flier competition.
Spitfire_Neutral__but are you sure it needs to be this complicated?
Spitfire_Neutral__right?
Spitfire_Neutral__what she said.

Spitfire_Shouting__Five hundred!
Spitfire_Shouting__Listen up!
Spitfire_Shouting__Wonderbolts, roll out!
Spitfire_Smug_Noisy_Bet y'all think you're wonderbolt material, don't ya?
Spitfire_Smug_Noisy_Bet you couldn't fly past the first flypole without getting winded.
Spitfire_Smug_Noisy_Not bad, for a couple of newbies.
Spitfire_Smug_Noisy_Think you got what it takes to be an elite flyer?
Spitfire_Smug_Noisy_Well lookie what we got here.
Spitfire_Smug_Noisy_Wise decision, rainbow dash.
Spitfire_Smug_Noisy_You look like you're the worst flyer in the whole academy.
Spitfire_Smug_Noisy_You'll probably quit after the first day.
Spitfire_Smug__So, what's it gonna be?
Spitfire_Surprised_Noisy_Already? that's an academy record!
Spitfire_Surprised_Noisy_Not bad! and in record time, too!
Spitfire_Surprised_Noisy_Six seconds! that's an academy record.
Spoiled Rich_Annoyed_Noisy_I just happened to be here For the school board meeting And this is what i see when we adjourn?
Spoiled Rich_Annoyed_Noisy_My daughter, associating with confused, insignificant lowlifes?
Spoiled Rich_Annoyed_Noisy_Step away from those blank flanks!
Spoiled Rich_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Diamond tiara!
Spoiled Rich_Annoyed_Very Noisy_That's enough diamond tiara!
Spoiled Rich_Annoyed_Very Noisy_What? you mean i have to own these party Supplies and celebrate nothing?
Spoiled Rich_Annoyed__Ever!
Spoiled Rich_Anxious_Noisy_yes, of course, dear.
Spoiled Rich_Neutral_Noisy_As a rich pony you must always think of your social standing.
Spoiled Rich_Neutral_Noisy_Diamond tiara! why are you making that face?
Spoiled Rich_Neutral_Noisy_Don't ever forget that diamond tiara.
Spoiled Rich_Neutral_Noisy_That is not the face of a winner.
Spoiled Rich_Neutral_Noisy_without steam, a steam room's just a room.
Spoiled Rich_Neutral_Very Noisy_Come, diamond tiara!
Spoiled Rich_Neutral__That starts here in ponyville, and reaches all over equestria.
Spoiled Rich_Neutral__and i've got plenty of those at home.
Spoiled Rich_Smug_Noisy_Socializing with their kind is not how you move up in equestria!
Spoiled Rich_Smug__But imagine if you lost to one of those, blank flanks.
Spoiled Rich_Smug__It's bad enough you lost to that transplant from trottingham.
Spoiled Rich_Smug__because i live in a mansion.
Spoiled Rich_Surprised Annoyed_Noisy_Excuse me!?
Spur_Amused__Bloofy definitely earned the Most Interesting Creature prize.
Spur_Annoyed Sarcastic__Sorry if I think taking care of Bloofy is more important than having fun!
Spur_Annoyed_Noisy_where were you when I was feeding and caring for him?!
Spur_Annoyed__Biscuit thinks he can just take Bloofy here to the fair.
Spur_Annoyed__It's one thing to bring Bloofy to the fair, but it's another to stick him in a showcase!
Spur_Annoyed__No, it isn't!
Spur_Annoyed__Since when?! Bloofy's never even seen a crowd!
Spur_Annoyed__What happened to being able to ask your advice?!
Spur_Annoyed__Which you'd know if you ever took care of him!
Spur_Annoyed__You ran off the second we got here!
Spur_Anxious__But Bloofy's never been around anything that exciting.
Spur_Anxious__That seems like a bad idea. What do you grown ups think?
Spur_Anxious__What if something goes wrong?
Spur_Anxious__Y'all don't really think that, do ya?
Spur_Anxious__You mean, like, leave?
Spur_Confused__What do you mean, seem like grown ups?
Spur_Confused__What do you mean?
Spur_Fear__Wild swamp ponies!
Spur_Happy__Hey there, Bloofy boo.
Spur_Happy__It's okay.
Spur_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, one thing's for sure.
Spur_Neutral__How did you know what to do?
Spur_Neutral__How?
Spur_Neutral__I guess grownups aren't always perfect.
Spur_Neutral__I guess that'd be okay.
Spur_Neutral__I'm Spur, and this is Biscuit.
Spur_Neutral__Okay, But that swamp is pretty confusing if you're not from around here.
Spur_Neutral__On one condition.
Spur_Neutral__That's why I came to find you.
Spur_Neutral__You get a real grown up to bring you.
Spur_Surprised Confused__That's Bloofy?!
Star Swirl_Annoyed_Noisy_There's no way to befriend a pony like that.
Star Swirl_Anxious_Noisy_It's the only way to stop him.
Star Swirl_Anxious_Noisy_No no no no! you must undo what you've done!
Star Swirl_Anxious_Noisy_Surely you have some other plan.
Star Swirl_Anxious_Noisy_You cannot bring only the pillars back!
Star Swirl_Anxious_Noisy_You cannot bring only the pillars back.
Star Swirl_Anxious_Noisy_You cannot bring us back!
Star Swirl_Anxious_Noisy_You have studied my writings.
Star Swirl_Anxious_Noisy_You must return us to limbo.
Star Swirl_Anxious_Very Noisy_Twilight! push him in!
Star Swirl_Confused_Noisy_To where?
Star Swirl_Confused_Noisy_Twilight?
Star Swirl_Confused_Noisy_Twilight? what's going on here?
Star Swirl_Confused_Noisy_What, what has happened?
Star Swirl_Happy_Noisy_The lessons in these worksheets are quite fascinating.
Star Swirl_Happy_Noisy_Well gentleponies, i've finished another stack.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_A necessary sacrifice.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_Ah, it seems i'll never stop learning From your example twilight.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_And thanks to twilight, We will remain to watch over the realm ourselves.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_And that desire led him down a path from which there is no return.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_And that in turning away from others, you hurt yourself as well.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_And the realm has been at peace for a millennia.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_Are you sure i can't give you more?
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_Be that as it may, the problem of locating the pony of shadows Remains.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_Don't be. i've more than enough magic in me To keep the everfree forest under control.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_Envy. he wanted more power than he had.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_Hmmm.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_I am not certain canterlot is where i belong.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_I didn't come for the school, But flim and flam convinced me to try it out.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_I spent a thousand years Thinking the worst of a bad pony.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_I suppose there is a chance.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_I will make my notes on this spell.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_I wish i had known it too.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_I wish to refine this spell for our use.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_I'm quite certain the headmare would consider letting you in.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_I-it it's really me.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_If the pony of shadows has his way, your land will not exist.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_Is a magical force indeed.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_It is a valuable lesson to stand up for what you know is true.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_It is an easy thing to say you have saved the world.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_It is quite another to do it.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_It is what must be done, and it would be best If we were not disturbed.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_It seems there are fewer dark corners in the realm these days.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_Know this, fiend.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_Mm hm.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_My travels brought me to las pegasus.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_Now!
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_Once a villain, always a villain.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_Ready yourselves for battle.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_She showed me that the power of friendship.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_So, unless you have a better idea.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_Something about this magic seems familiar.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_Something tells me i will be making a lot of apologies today.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_Stygian wants to destroy all that is good in this world.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_Stygian! show yourself and face us!
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_The only pony i see who's up to something is the pony In this picture, and it is not the princess i know.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_The pillars and i planted the tree of harmony.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_The pony of shadows was not interested in reconciliation.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_The realm has grown, and i believe i'll have a look around before i settle in any one place.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_The tree of harmony acting to protect the light of the realm.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_These lessons are so valuable.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_This is hardly the time to take risks on half baked spells.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_This map and, indeed, this very castle, are grown from the seed We planted over a thousand years ago.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_Twilight? sunburst? would you accompany me?
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_We can use the stored magic, in this tree of harmony.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_We did not come here to defeat you.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_We shall see.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_We will not rest until we find a way to return you to limbo.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_We would be honored, but if it is wisdom you seek, Look no further than your own pupil.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_Well, i can refer you to a fairly reputable establishment.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_While i appreciate your enthusiasm twilight.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_Who do you think kept the forest under control Before it did?
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_Why studying friendship, at flim and flam's wonderful school.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_With the elements' power, We will bind the pony of shadows in limbo.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_Yes, a good thought twilight.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_You tried to steal our powers for yourself.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_and i know ponies who represent them all.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_and this land is vast.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_but we shall leave behind a seed, in hopes that one day, it will grow into a force to stand against the darkness for all time.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_but we soon came to believe the pony who brought us together, only wanted that power, for himself.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_i felt it, when it happened.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_i know. i alerted the princesses as soon as i could.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_like part of my essence just, ceased to be.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_more importantly, we no longer need ponhenge To send our foe back to limbo.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_nopony is meant to handle this on their own.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_ready? Open the portal.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_strength, bravery, healing, beauty, hope, and sorcery.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_stygian Was the name the pony of shadows gave up When he turned to darkness.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_the best elements within us can spread light and virtue.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_to stop him, the pillars and i must make a grave sacrifice.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_transformed into a pony of shadows, he returned for revenge, to extinguish the pillars' light, and rob the world of hope.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_we did what we had to do.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Noisy_we must now face the fiend, with the only plan we have.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Very Noisy_He is here.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Very Noisy_Hm.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Very Noisy_I will prepare my spell, So that we may strike as soon as you find him.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Very Noisy_It will take time, but with the princesses' help, i can keep it at bay.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Very Noisy_Our foe will seek dark places from which to draw power.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Very Noisy_Prepare yourselves.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Very Noisy_Then we must help him.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Very Noisy_We came, to contain you.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Very Noisy_and yet, even a pony as old as i, can continue to be surprised.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Very Noisy_by how much there is to know.
Star Swirl_Neutral_Very Noisy_you would think after more than a thousand years, there would be nothing left to learn.
Star Swirl_Neutral__Besides, what's untrustworthy About opening a school of friendship?
Star Swirl_Neutral__But for now, perhaps it's best if you return there.
Star Swirl_Neutral__Canterlot depends on us!
Star Swirl_Neutral__I simply cannot believe how tall you've gotten!
Star Swirl_Neutral__Just outside of ponyville.
Star Swirl_Neutral__Long ago you needed our help stygian.
Star Swirl_Neutral__Return the bits you've collected from Your students and close your school?
Star Swirl_Neutral__Spread out and stay ready, friends!
Star Swirl_Neutral__Starting this school shows they want to change for the better.
Star Swirl_Neutral__The elements are attuned to you.
Star Swirl_Neutral__Then my spell worked, before it was meddled with.
Star Swirl_Neutral__They don't even charge for classes.
Star Swirl_Neutral__Twilight, i promise i'll visit your school soon.
Star Swirl_Neutral__We must use their magic in pairs.
Star Swirl_Neutral__Whatever flim and flam's past may be.
Star Swirl_Neutral__You taught me to look for the best in him.
Star Swirl_Neutral__cast out and alone, this power mad pony, turned to darkness, to satisfy his thirst.
Star Swirl_Neutral__myself and these pillars of equestria were gathered together by another to maintain and share the light of these powerful ideals.
Star Swirl_Sad_Noisy_I owe you an apology.
Star Swirl_Sad_Noisy_It seems i never accounted for the magic, of friendship.
Star Swirl_Sad_Noisy_Thank you for, helping us see the errors of our ways twilight.
Star Swirl_Sad__But instead of listening, we turned our backs on you.
Star Swirl_Sad__Pride, clouded my judgment.
Star Swirl_Sarcastic_Noisy_I doubt we can save our homeland with a conversation.
Starlight_Amused_Noisy_Even if it takes, a little help.
Starlight_Amused_Noisy_I had my village convinced we were being attacked By bears every night.
Starlight_Amused_Noisy_It could be because you're just yelling tea cup And not picturing it in your mind.
Starlight_Amused_Noisy_Would you go save equestria already?
Starlight_Amused_Noisy_i'm not gonna cheer you up.
Starlight_Amused_Noisy_well, i think you're the crystal empire's big, important wizard, whether you like it or not.
Starlight_Amused_Very Noisy_But i didn't think there were this many lessons for anything.
Starlight_Amused_Very Noisy_Definitely not.
Starlight_Amused_Very Noisy_I think it'll be pretty easy to figure out who she is.
Starlight_Amused_Very Noisy_for a pony who isn't great at magic, you did pretty well.
Starlight_Amused__Are you kidding? you're the first pony i've met who has any idea how i feel.
Starlight_Amused__I meant stage magic.
Starlight_Amused__Mostly so we know not to do it again.
Starlight_Angry Shouting_Noisy_Everycreature, stop!
Starlight_Angry Shouting_Very Noisy_I created harmony!
Starlight_Angry Shouting_Very Noisy_I was perfectly happy before you And your friends ruined what i built!
Starlight_Angry Shouting_Very Noisy_I'll show you!
Starlight_Angry Shouting_Very Noisy_You want to know what happened to me!?
Starlight_Angry Shouting__Because you're driving us crazy!
Starlight_Angry Shouting__He moved on, and i didn't!
Starlight_Angry_Noisy_And the worst part is, You didn't even say you were sorry!
Starlight_Angry_Noisy_Discord, that's enough!
Starlight_Angry_Noisy_Grrr discord!
Starlight_Angry_Noisy_I stayed here and never made another friend Because i was too afraid another Cutie mark would take them away too!
Starlight_Angry_Noisy_My village was a sanctuary of equality, Where nopony's cutie mark allowed them to feel superior!
Starlight_Angry_Noisy_Yeah. i do.
Starlight_Angry_Very Noisy_And when i destroy this scroll, There'll be no way for you to change it!
Starlight_Angry_Very Noisy_But once i stop the rainboom, you will!
Starlight_Angry_Very Noisy_But we turned out different, And it tore our friendship apart!
Starlight_Angry_Very Noisy_Cutie marks for cutie marks!
Starlight_Angry_Very Noisy_No! you're supposed to concentrate on the object! Not just teleporting!
Starlight_Angry_Very Noisy_Not everypony's lucky enough to get Their cutie mark at the same time as her friends!
Starlight_Angry_Very Noisy_Now it's my turn to take something special from you!
Starlight_Angry_Very Noisy_Quiet!
Starlight_Angry_Very Noisy_Sounds like a fair trade to me!
Starlight_Angry_Very Noisy_They think they can come to my village and disrupt my life.
Starlight_Angry_Very Noisy_You don't know what it's like to lose A friend because of a cutie mark.
Starlight_Angry_Very Noisy_i hate hearth's warming eve!
Starlight_Angry__Because of his cutie mark!
Starlight_Angry__Fine!
Starlight_Angry__I'm a grown pony with a job to do, and i'll do it on my own.
Starlight_Angry__I'm not a filly.
Starlight_Angry__It was a special place, and you and your friends took it away!
Starlight_Angry__oh Well, maybe i should just head home.
Starlight_Annoyed Sad__I wonder what that says about how you feel about me.
Starlight_Annoyed Sarcastic_Noisy_Do you suppose the terrifying trunk escape is too much for a Pony who drinks all the juice and talks nonstop in her sleep?
Starlight_Annoyed Sarcastic_Noisy_Oh, i'm sorry. I didn't realize you were better friends With that beat up old wagon than you are with me.
Starlight_Annoyed Sarcastic_Noisy_What if the great and powerful trixie.
Starlight_Annoyed Sarcastic_Noisy_genius.
Starlight_Annoyed Sarcastic_Noisy_telling everypony that singing songs and being nice will solve anything?
Starlight_Annoyed Sarcastic_Very Noisy_I tried.
Starlight_Annoyed Sarcastic_Very Noisy_Ugh, what's so special about your friends!?
Starlight_Annoyed Sarcastic__Why, so you can laugh at me some more?
Starlight_Annoyed Shouting_Noisy_Enough!
Starlight_Annoyed Shouting_Very Noisy_pare down a bit!
Starlight_Annoyed Shouting__Guys!
Starlight_Annoyed Whispering_Noisy_Is he going to be following us for the whole time?
Starlight_Annoyed_Noisy_And it might be here because, somepony was craving apples.
Starlight_Annoyed_Noisy_Discord, you can't keep messing up the school.
Starlight_Annoyed_Noisy_Endangering students crosses the line!
Starlight_Annoyed_Noisy_Go ahead, I'm going to have a chat, with these two.
Starlight_Annoyed_Noisy_Guidance counseling is for talking out your problems, Not telling me everything that's ever happened in the history of equestria!
Starlight_Annoyed_Noisy_Hey!
Starlight_Annoyed_Noisy_I brought you friendship! i brought you equality!
Starlight_Annoyed_Noisy_I don't know why you're trying to ruin this school, But it stops now!
Starlight_Annoyed_Noisy_I knew you couldn't be trusted!
Starlight_Annoyed_Noisy_I thought we moved past this.
Starlight_Annoyed_Noisy_If it weren't for my magical abilities.
Starlight_Annoyed_Noisy_Kindly point them out.
Starlight_Annoyed_Noisy_Never mind.
Starlight_Annoyed_Noisy_No, i'm starlight.
Starlight_Annoyed_Noisy_Obviously i wanted you to.
Starlight_Annoyed_Noisy_Really?
Starlight_Annoyed_Noisy_Really?
Starlight_Annoyed_Noisy_Seriously!?
Starlight_Annoyed_Noisy_Spare me your sentimental nonsense! I gave these ponies real friendships they never could have had otherwise!
Starlight_Annoyed_Noisy_That map of yours is connected to every part of equestria, And this part, is my home.
Starlight_Annoyed_Noisy_The staff is a piece of wood i found in the desert.
Starlight_Annoyed_Noisy_Trixie, you ruined my tea cakes!
Starlight_Annoyed_Noisy_Trixie.

Starlight_Annoyed_Noisy_Why should you let somepony else Stop you from doing your job?
Starlight_Annoyed_Noisy_all of equestria would be better off if we just skipped the day altogether.
Starlight_Annoyed_Noisy_at home.
Starlight_Annoyed_Noisy_i've spent years studying magic and that's not how it works.
Starlight_Annoyed_Noisy_that silly legend is the problem!
Starlight_Annoyed_Noisy_those foolish ponies were ringing those blasted bells outside the window and i lost my concentration.
Starlight_Annoyed_Noisy_ugh, Why do you keep doing that?
Starlight_Annoyed_Noisy_well you don't know what it was like to be left behind!
Starlight_Annoyed_Noisy_what are you doing here?
Starlight_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Are you all so willing to give up everything because of these, strangers?
Starlight_Annoyed_Very Noisy_But if you're there, who's in here?

Starlight_Annoyed_Very Noisy_How can a group of ponies That are so different, be so important!?
Starlight_Annoyed_Very Noisy_I don't believe you!
Starlight_Annoyed_Very Noisy_I only saw what you showed me! Who knows what'll really happen?
Starlight_Annoyed_Very Noisy_It's not haunted, it's discord.
Starlight_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Of course it's her. what's all this about?
Starlight_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Rarity! make it bigger than the one in the book.
Starlight_Annoyed_Very Noisy_So back at your castle when you said, i trust you, You meant, i don't trust you.
Starlight_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Spare me your overblown ego! No group of friends, Not even princess twilight's, is that important!
Starlight_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Starlight, you clumsy fool!
Starlight_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Ugh, i was horrible when i led that town.

Starlight_Annoyed__Dad!
Starlight_Annoyed__Dad!
Starlight_Annoyed__Dad, you promised no pumpkie wumpkins in public.
Starlight_Annoyed__Even after twilight says she trusts me, She clearly doesn't trust me enough To choose my own friends.
Starlight_Annoyed__Guys?
Starlight_Annoyed__In the present.
Starlight_Annoyed__My dad, won't even let me talk to anypony, In case they're strangers. i'm a grown mare!
Starlight_Annoyed__Now we have to smooth things over with our parents On top of finding and solving a friendship problem.
Starlight_Annoyed__Quit it.
Starlight_Annoyed__Really?!
Starlight_Annoyed__Seriously?
Starlight_Annoyed__So you just brought me along to do your legwork?
Starlight_Annoyed__That's the same as it ever was.
Starlight_Annoyed__The things you gave me are silly?
Starlight_Annoyed__Ugh, i am never gonna find my way around this place!
Starlight_Annoyed__Ugh.
Starlight_Annoyed__What is going on?
Starlight_Annoyed__When would i have done that?
Starlight_Annoyed__You didn't make an appointment.

Starlight_Annoyed__i don't understand anything you're saying.
Starlight_Annoyed__sunburst!
Starlight_Annoyed__ugh.
Starlight_Annoyed__urgh, what i'm saying is, We need a way to help you two reconnect.
Starlight_Anxious Amused_Noisy_What? no. i do like it.
Starlight_Anxious Annoyed_Noisy_No!
Starlight_Anxious Annoyed__i had to, you fools. How could i collect your cutiemarks without my magic?
Starlight_Anxious Confused_Noisy_I thought we were friends.
Starlight_Anxious Confused_Noisy_I thought you didn't wanna play this game.
Starlight_Anxious Confused_Noisy_Princess luna? w-what are you doing here?
Starlight_Anxious Confused_Noisy_What? why are ponies cancelling their orders?
Starlight_Anxious Confused_Noisy_You want me to be headmare?
Starlight_Anxious Confused_Noisy_and this just happened now And and not in my dream?
Starlight_Anxious Confused_Very Noisy_How in equestria did you get all of this done so fast?
Starlight_Anxious Confused_Very Noisy_I'm not doing this.
Starlight_Anxious Confused_Very Noisy_Party favor? can you hear me?
Starlight_Anxious Confused_Very Noisy_What happened?
Starlight_Anxious Confused_Very Noisy_What? what are you talking about? this is just a dream!
Starlight_Anxious Confused_Very Noisy_what's going on?
Starlight_Anxious Confused_Very Noisy_what's happening to you?
Starlight_Anxious Confused__What is happening around here?
Starlight_Anxious Confused__What?
Starlight_Anxious Confused__You win? that sounds like you just made friends with me To beat twilight.
Starlight_Anxious Confused__is anypony there?
Starlight_Anxious Sad_Noisy_I cast the spell because i was nervous about working with you On the friendship lessons.
Starlight_Anxious Sad_Noisy_and i'm relearning everything i ever thought i knew.
Starlight_Anxious Sad_Noisy_i'm really, mad at you.
Starlight_Anxious Sad_Very Noisy_How do i know they won't all end the same way?
Starlight_Anxious Sad_Very Noisy_I can't even find my way around twilight's castle.
Starlight_Anxious Sad_Very Noisy_With my past, i should never be in charge of anything.
Starlight_Anxious Sad_Very Noisy_i wouldn't be surprised if twilight decides to, give up on me entirely.
Starlight_Anxious Sad__I'm really sorry, i used magic so i wouldn't use magic.
Starlight_Anxious Sad__Well, when you put it that way, it sounds really bad.
Starlight_Anxious Sarcastic_Noisy_What could possibly go wrong?
Starlight_Anxious Sarcastic_Very Noisy_Great.
Starlight_Anxious Sarcastic__Great.
Starlight_Anxious Shouting__And now you want me to do it permanently!?
Starlight_Anxious Surprised_Noisy_i studied that spell for years! how can you.
Starlight_Anxious Surprised_Very Noisy_Huh? oh.
Starlight_Anxious Whispering_Noisy_He's going to think i'm nuts.
Starlight_Anxious Whispering_Noisy_I thought you said they were solitary.
Starlight_Anxious Whispering_Noisy_one of them.
Starlight_Anxious Whispering_Very Noisy_You know that's not discord, right?
Starlight_Anxious Whispering__Their gaze can turn you to stone.
Starlight_Anxious Whispering__Whatever you do, don't look at them.
Starlight_Anxious Whispering__we need to find this friendship problem, now.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_A handful of friendship lessons is nothing Compared to the spells you've mastered.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_A-any luck?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Actually thorax, um, Never mind.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_After we left my village!
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Ah, i can't! i'm not ready! Remember what happened the last time You left me in charge!?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_All this magical energy has to go somewhere.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_And if i'm not using it to fight a magical duel Or bend my friends' wills to obey my every command.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_And instead of talking about it, They're just getting colder and more distant.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_And obviously twilight and the others, But maybe cadance is still safe.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Are you still sure this isn't a friendship problem?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Are you sure it's safe?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Are you sure?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_At least your friendship problem is in ponyville?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Because i am totally going to take care of them.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Besides, we've almost looked at everything, right?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_But i would like to point out that my admittedly terrible plan Did bring everything together in the end.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_But if we do manage to destroy chrysalis' throne, We'll need him.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_But, the school's closed. all the students are gone.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_But, what if trixie really was using me just to one up you?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Chrysalis and the changelings are back.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Cut! it! out!
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Did i forget something?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Did the changelings get cadance too?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Do you see this storm cloud?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Ember's eaten all of twilight's decorations and.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Everything except how i'd rather do Absolutely anything else.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Excuse me, when does the noon train From the crystal empire arrive?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Eye shape?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Glowing map.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Going with my gut was the wrong call!
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Granny smith, please, the table?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Ha ha hah, don't worry.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Happy, surprised, overwhelmed I mean, not that i'm not grateful but, are you sure?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Have you seen a big table? magical map on it? Sometimes glowing cutie marks shoot out?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Hey twilight, can i ask you something about the crystal empire?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Hey, mudbriar! Have you ever flown a kite?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_How much of that did you hear?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_I also wasn't nervous before, but now.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_I am so sorry about that.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_I am so sorry about today. i'm just so.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_I cast a spell for our field trip to cloudsdale But my magic just, failed!
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_I didn't want to lose you as a friend.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_I don't know folks, She's been in there a long time.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_I don't suppose there's, more juice?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_I don't understand! I-it's like my spell stopped working!
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_I don't understand.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_I feel like we should step back, take a deep breath.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_I hope it's not a left over pinkie pie.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_I just banished him from school grounds forever, He's fine.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_I know starswirl is a great wizard But, this whole plan seems, wrong.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_I like, kites.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_I mean, if you like it, i like it.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_I mean, it's been a long time. Maybe the pony of shadows is ready to talk?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_I might have re-laid them to lead it back toward the hive.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_I really hope twilight knows what she's doing.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_I should have been watching where i was going.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_I still can't believe you're letting me stay here, as your pupil.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_I think so, but you kinda, sorta, got in the way.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_I think the.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_I thought you said you could beat this thing!
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_I was so worried about doing things twilight's way, I didn't stop to think about being a good friend.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_I was supposed to bring you two closer together, But i've only driven you apart!
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_I went with my gut?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_I won't know what to do, we've already lost discord, i can't lose you too.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_I'm glad twilight isn't here to see this.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_I'm just barely keeping it together, And it would be wonderful if you two could actually try to help, Instead of bickering like foals.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_I'm never taking time off From my counseling duties again!
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_I'm so confused.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_I, i don't know. there has to be somepony else Who can handle this.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_I-i don't know.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_I-i-i'm sure that's not what princess luna meant to say.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_If she knew what i was thinking right now, She'd probably never talk to me again.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Instead, my student is missing.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Is that a promise?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Is this really happening?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_It's late. i think i figured out what's wrong with my friends.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_It's really, really important that we find it.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_It's, what celestia would do.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Just uh.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Loud? heh heh.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Magically stole everypony's cutie mark, replaced them with equal signs and forced them all To hide their natural talents?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Maud, we've got to get out of here.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Maybe?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_My apologies your majesties but, i can't, even if i wanted to.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Nervous?! me! hahaha. oh spike.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Never mind.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Nice surprise.

Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_No trix, wait. not just.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_No worries. we'll just take a walk around town.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_No! get away!
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_No! trixie, we're in danger!
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_No, in a good way.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_No.

Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Nope.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Of course! no problem. friendship lesson. on it!
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Oh hey, twilight.

Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Oh wait! missus cake! you can't close.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Oh, i-i shouldn't. you all go ahead.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Oh. yeah. sorry.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Ok, maybe there is such a thing as too cozy.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Opening portals between worlds didn't work out well for me.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Or is this still a dream?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Please, twilight! i know you're trying to help.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Please.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Princess luna!
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Princess luna! wait.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Queen chrysalis!
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Right after i take care of what i am sure Is an even smaller student problem than the last one.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Right, sorry, i'm just a little excited Because my friend sunburst is coming.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Right.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Right.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_See ya later.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Shouldn't be hard.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Silverstream didn't come home?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Silverstream, look out!
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Silverstream?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Sleeping in tight quarters bonding.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_So now what?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_So, i'm hoping if i bottle up my anger, I won't do who knows what to trixie.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Sure did.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_That should have been the first place we looked!
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_That's a nice way of saying i came dangerously close To messing everything up.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_That's not.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_That's what's happening now!
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_The nearby towns have been in a state of panic for weeks.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_The only way to be happy is if we are all equal.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_The point is, i don't know what my magic's going to do.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Then who's going to stop the dread maulwurf i'm leading here?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_There!
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_They do, don't you see? Look at them!
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_This has never happened before.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_This place is awful! How did i not see it before?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Thorax might need our help.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Thorax! there you are!
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Trixie and i need to learn the recipe For your equinox cake.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Trixie, i-i can't leave. it's almost spring break.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Trixie, we have to get that map back.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Trixie?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Trixie? trixie, it's starlight! are you awake?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Twilight and the girls are gonna be back soon.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Twilight's figuring out what my first friendship lesson is.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Twilight's never going to trust me to be alone In this castle again!
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Uh, i know i'm not as experienced as all of you But, is banishment really the only option?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Uh, that's a pretty big responsibility twilight.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Uh, twilight? are you ok?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Um, sure.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Um, twilight, what are you doing?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Um, you are scowling.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Wait, let's all slow down and talk about this.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Wait. what's that?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_We don't have time for this!
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_We think she went in to do research on cockatrices.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_We're surrounded by a flock of petrifying chicken snakes, And maud's boyfriend was turned into a hunk of rock!
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Well, she's not here.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_What a.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_What choice do i have? i've got to get that map back And, i don't want to lose trixie.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_What i did was wrong a-and i can't take it back.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_What're you looking at? They're the problem, not me!
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_What?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_What? no!
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_What? oh, no, heh, those all sound great!
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Whoo. nope. not mad at all.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Without magic, i have no idea. but, nopony else is coming,.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Yay?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Yeah.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Yes! baking a cake, sewing, all of it.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Yes.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_You can't.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_You check the grounds and i'll look inside.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_You go ahead, i'll stay here.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_You guys have the same.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_You made twilight's friendship map disappear!
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_You need to put on a brave face and help these ponies.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_You really are hilarious haha, you think i'm nervous?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Your brother is um, challenging.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_Your drama can wait! twilight needs help, now!
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_er Tea, anypony? cucumber sandwich?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_glowing spikes.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_how could i possibly forget about that?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_i think. wait. was it?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_i want to say something, but it goes against everything I've been taught as twilight's pupil.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_if i hadn't galloped off to a holiday celebration, Silverstream would be safe with her family And, you'd all be enjoying maud's party.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_is gone, the baby, shining armor and cadance's baby, it's an alicorn.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_of course! you're an important wizard in the crystal empire, it just makes sense.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_short?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_sunburst, i know you're busy, but did you hear what i said?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_there's still time!
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_uh I'm, sure we'll find something.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_uh, you're right, you're right heh.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_what? you want me to take care of the castle and run the school?
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_which i'm supposed to be doing right now!
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_without magic i.
Starlight_Anxious_Noisy_you should see his house!
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_A dream! this is another dream!
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_A lot less threatening when there were two of us.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Actually twilight, i am a little worried about meeting sunburst.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_And listens when one of them finds a better way.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_And the three of us are as good as useless. At least thorax knows where we're going.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_And, i know what it's like To want everypony to do what you say.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Anycreature?
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_But have they? they don't really know how much i've changed.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_But i was wrong. a real leader doesn't force her subjects To deny who they are.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Celestia, luna, cadance, shining armor, flurry heart, Twilight and her friends. we need to.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Could you all, excuse me for, one, second?
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Cut my losses? that can't be right.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Day, night, sun, moon, equestria needs both of you.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Don't ask me! i couldn't even handle giving advice At the sunset festival, and i had magic then.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Don't do this to each other!
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Exactly. thorax left the hive and made a friend.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Hey! uh, pinkie pie!
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_How do we choose?
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_I can handle this. it's just magic, and i know magic.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_I don't see her anywhere.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_I know what it's like to lead by fear and intimidation.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_I meant just the one cake! i was only gone a few minutes!
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_I was just trying to decide which friendship lesson I was going to tackle while you two were in canterlot.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_I was ready for them to not trust me but.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_I'm so sorry, twilight!
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_I-i mean, did something happen to you after you left for magic school?
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_If i can't make a friend here, There's got to be something wrong with me.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_It's, the ponies from my old village.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Maybe if i cast a little spell to help things along.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Maybe the congratulations were a little premature.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_My fault. totally my fault. are you ok?
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_No! i, i don't see what that has to do with anything, W-why would you even ask that?
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_No! stop!
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_No, it's worse.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_No? what did i miss?
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Nope, not at all! I'm good here oh not good great Not a problem in the world.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Oh! it's only a dream.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Oh, what now?
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Oh, yup. right here. where i just left them a second ago.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Ok, starlight. you've got this.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Or even worse, maybe i haven't changed as much As i think i have!
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Pinkie, what are you doing?!
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Princess luna, where are you?
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Right, me neither.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Sharing love is what made you different to begin with.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_She celebrates what makes them unique.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Sorry i'm late. i got a little turned around.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Spike, are you here?
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Stop stressing. stop stressing!
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Stop! it's me!
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Storm clouds?!
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Then, don't!
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_They've invited me to the annual sunset festival!
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_They've ponynapped all of the most powerful ponies In equestria.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_They've ponynapped all of the most powerful ponies In equestria.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_This can't get any worse.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Thorax?
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Trixie! wake up!
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Twilight!
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_W-wait wait! calm down, every creature! It's gonna be ok!
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Wait, what!? trixie you can't.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_We have an emergency.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_We need water!
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Well, it was the first time i cast that particular spell And i didn't fully think it through.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_What are we diving into?
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_What are you saying, who's taken you?
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_What plan? why did you do all this?
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_What's that?
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_When twilight and her friends defeated me, I chose to run away and seek revenge. you don't have to.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_With my past, i should never be in charge of anything.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Without balance, there's no harmony!
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_Yes but, that's just doesn't seem right.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_You all seemed.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_You aren't acting like yourself.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_You don't have to live your lives starving all the time!
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_You should share yours with chrysalis!
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_You won't get away with this!
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_and since no pony has any better ideas, what do we have to lose?

Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_i brought, gifts.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_i didn't see how important hearth's warming eve was!
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_i was hoping i wasn't too late for the party.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_i wasn't ready For them to put me in charge again.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_is there anything i can do?
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_is there still time? i'm sorry!

Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_please, spirit! i haven't cast the spell yet!
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_spirit? what am i supposed to.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_spirit? what do you mean? what's going to happen?
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_sunburst! haven't you looked outside?
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_unless you've got a spell here that will drive back the frozen north and fix the crystal hear so the baby can have her crystalling?
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_we have to go back!
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_what is going on!?
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_what's wrong with you? why are you being so.
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_why not?
Starlight_Anxious_Very Noisy_you need to get to the train station.
Starlight_Anxious__A changeling. I think they've taken princess celestia and princess luna.
Starlight_Anxious__And i have to help the students with any issues before they head home for the holiday.
Starlight_Anxious__And ruin her surprise party?
Starlight_Anxious__And thorax has a duty to the whole hive, Not just his brother.
Starlight_Anxious__And to top it off, we have no idea if silverstream Even came to everfree at all.
Starlight_Anxious__But being a leader is the last thing i should ever be.
Starlight_Anxious__But i have no idea where else to look!
Starlight_Anxious__But you can't dwell on that now.
Starlight_Anxious__But, i apologized. i thought everything was fine.
Starlight_Anxious__But, i don't want to ruin your party.
Starlight_Anxious__But, the lesson.
Starlight_Anxious__But, you can't keep treating me like a foal.
Starlight_Anxious__Cool.
Starlight_Anxious__Everypony is acting a little strange today.
Starlight_Anxious__Gone like gone to the throne room?
Starlight_Anxious__Heh enslaving villages, i guess.
Starlight_Anxious__Heh, i know, weird, right?
Starlight_Anxious__How do i start?
Starlight_Anxious__I can cast complex spells But, baking a cake with pinkie pie freaks me out.
Starlight_Anxious__I don't know, spike.
Starlight_Anxious__I guess i'm still trying to find my way around.
Starlight_Anxious__I have to go. You got this?
Starlight_Anxious__I know, hang on.
Starlight_Anxious__I mean, he's probably some big important wizard now, and.
Starlight_Anxious__I need to talk to twilight.
Starlight_Anxious__I should never have traded away the wagon.
Starlight_Anxious__I think the problem might be between celestia and luna.
Starlight_Anxious__I thought if pharynx saw you were in danger the loving, Caring side of him would come out when he protected you.
Starlight_Anxious__I'm good!
Starlight_Anxious__I'm not ready to leave!
Starlight_Anxious__I'm the one who didn't do my job When it actually mattered.
Starlight_Anxious__I, don't know.
Starlight_Anxious__I-i just want to enjoy the festival.
Starlight_Anxious__I-i mean.
Starlight_Anxious__I-i think you're accidentally hurting each other's feelings.
Starlight_Anxious__I-it may have been extreme but er, I think it's still a good idea?
Starlight_Anxious__I.
Starlight_Anxious__If i'm right, then it's too late for that.
Starlight_Anxious__If this is about brunch, i.
Starlight_Anxious__If we can't find that table, Twilight's never going to trust me again.
Starlight_Anxious__If we're gonna do this, let's do it.
Starlight_Anxious__It belongs to my friend.
Starlight_Anxious__It was the right call, i hope.
Starlight_Anxious__It wasn't mine to trade.
Starlight_Anxious__It's not that i don't want to go home it's just that, whenever i do.
Starlight_Anxious__It's not your fault, It's everypony else's!
Starlight_Anxious__It's, it's me, starlight.
Starlight_Anxious__Me? oh, you know, some of this, some of that, different.
Starlight_Anxious__New friends?
Starlight_Anxious__No way! She's always needed you guys!
Starlight_Anxious__No!
Starlight_Anxious__No! i mean, yes. Totally excited about us going together just, not so excited about where.
Starlight_Anxious__No! you can't do that!
Starlight_Anxious__Not stuff i'm super eager to tell sunburst about.
Starlight_Anxious__Not that you had one.
Starlight_Anxious__Now, you'll know exactly what it's like to, be each other!
Starlight_Anxious__Ocellus, it's perfectly normal for a changeling To struggle with identity issues, but.
Starlight_Anxious__Oh, boy.
Starlight_Anxious__Oh, uh, don't be ridiculous!
Starlight_Anxious__Only his body.
Starlight_Anxious__Or that i'm not grateful for everything she's doing!
Starlight_Anxious__Our best bet is to get to the crystal empire Before the changelings do.
Starlight_Anxious__Pharynx is missing!
Starlight_Anxious__Princess luna?
Starlight_Anxious__Reading an exciting book.
Starlight_Anxious__So what? everything else i said is true.

Starlight_Anxious__completely and utterly evil.
Starlight_Anxious__i forgot to tell you, they're evacuating the city!

Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_A cutie mark camp is a great idea.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_A dread maulwurf wreaking havoc outside.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_A pony with a diferent cutiemark in our midst would destroy our entire philosophy!
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_A-actually that's not food.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_A-actually, i'm pretty sure she's busy with princess stuff today.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Absolutely.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_According to the list, some delegates are about to arrive For a luncheon.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Actually, i think you're doing all right.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Actually, i'm starlight. Starlight glimmer.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Actually, it's missing something.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Actually, you created the friendship problem By not trusting your friends.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_After all, nopony has ever come to our village and wanted to leave!
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Ahem, go ahead. i'm listening.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Ahhh. this is just what i needed.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_All right! i'll change him back!
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_And a magical temper tantrum?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_And i hear you're the best out there.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_And i promised trixie we'd practice more magic.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_And i used to be a dictator who ran a village with an iron hoof.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_And i'll keep maud busy while you and mudbriar Plan the best surprise birthday ever.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_And i'm gonna keep that promise.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_And i'm just trying to figure out, why.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_And isn't teamwork a key factor in friendship?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_And now everything should run smoothly.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_And now it's your chance to prove you're just as strong Embracing love, as you were feeding on it.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_And now you are.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_And our message of.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_And she left pretty detailed instructions for me to follow.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_And so much else.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_And there's no such thing as too cozy.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_And we never had to say it but, we got each other.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_And when you offered to help, i didn't listen.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_And you're in charge of all the friendship in equestria.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Anypony?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Anyway, you were saying?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Apparently his ghost can come and go just fine.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Are you baking? can i help?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Are you sure this is different?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Around here we don't, flaunt our special talents Because, we don't have any special talents to flaunt.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Aw, come on, spike! i want to hear about the games too!
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Banish stygian to limbo. i get it.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Because of thorax.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Because they're pretty?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Before chrysalis' throne was destroyed, The closest magic would have gotten us was, way over there.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Being able to use the experiences Of my checkered past to help young students Feels pretty great.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Blinded by the false promise of our cutie marks.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_But for now, the counselor's office is closed.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_But how? and where did they go?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_But i think things turned out Just the way you'd have handled them.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_But i'm not upset. what's our next stop?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_But i've learned sometimes talking isn't enough.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_But if they're too light you got no ballast And then good luck tacking against the a o i.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_But if you're there, who's in here?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_But it has to come from somewhere.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_But now that the changelings don't feed on the love of Everything around them, plants have started to grow back.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_But oh, one sec.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_But remember when you didn't have a choice. When you were forced to obey chrysalis.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_But sometimes friendships can't be explained.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_But that is entirely your choice.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_But this maulwurf keeps eating them all up.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_But to be fair, i don't know how you could have known.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_But we could just buy a cake from her, right?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_But we could try.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_But why did he steal the artifacts from you?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_But, can i borrow apple bloom sweetie belle and scootaloo?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_But, i need to make friends on my own If i'm going to become a better pony.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_But, i was thinking of another way That maybe doesn't involve banishing, at all?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_But, if you're sure it's what you really want.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_But, maybe don't express how you feel by destroying them?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_But, that doesn't mean i can't help With all the things we have to do.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_But, that isn't a license to be cruel, is it?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_But, then i messed with one and nearly destroyed the universe, So.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_But, twilight has asked me to stay here to run the school.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_But, we probably need a better solution here.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_But, what would happen if we added Sonambula's tempus objectus?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_But, you showed me that when you know in your heart Something is right, you stand up for it.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Calm down, unscareable trixie.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Can i vent for a minute?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Can you come to twilight's class with me? i-it won't take long.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Can you please round up all the animals in the castle And bring them back here to the foyer.

Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Didn't you say zecora was working on a cure?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Do you have any of your smoke bombs?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Do you suppose, the terrifying trunk escape Is too much for her?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Do you think if i had set times to see me, It might help you decide What you really need to talk about?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Doing stage magic with trixie?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Don't tell me, um.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Don't worry about it.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Don't worry spike, Discord and i are old save equestria buddies. He'll be fine.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Don't worry twilight, i'm sure lots of other ponies Are being inspired to be better friends.

Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Great. now, rainbow dash.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Guess i make a pretty good guidance counselor, huh?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Guess smiling all day isn't as easy as you thought?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Guess that explains your love of charts.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Ha! straight to the changeling hive.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Hang out in nature.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Have a great time.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Have you considered perhaps that you might have been sent here So we, could help you?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Have you ever come across some kind of super powerful stone That can store the cutie mark magic of, i don't know, An entire village?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Have you two noticed pinkie acting a little strange?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_He could take on the entire changeling army By sneezing if he wanted to.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_He's dealing with the wants and needs of his subjects.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_He's my oldest friend.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Heh heh heh. ah. i like her.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Here, Try an apple. I bet that'll jog your memory.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Here, i, um, brought you snacks.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Hey thorax.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Hey! i'm back early.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Hey, is that.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Hey, pharynx.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Hey, you made me a guidance counselor, That means tough love.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Hi, i'm starlight glimmer. what's your name?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Hint hint.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Hmm. nothing just disappears so that's technically A teleportation spell, and those are pretty hard.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Huh oh well, i'm ready for him.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Huh. you must be mudbriar.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I am really impressed, thorax.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I appreciate you trying to help, twilight.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I asked luna if i could spend some time with her this evening.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I can pop back to the castle and grab it.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I can't be friends with somepony who doesn't talk.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I can't believe you cook it yourself.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I can't believe you're actually going through with it.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I created a spell so we could relive playing a game In our childhood home.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I did a spell. i bottled up my anger, But when the bottle broke, it infected these three.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I don't know why i got so worried about us Not having anything in common.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I guess i shouldn't have broken the seal to get in, But, you wanted to see the sights of ponyville, right?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I guess we can give it a whirl.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I have to get all the facts.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I hope you're enjoying your visit so far.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I just want to, blend in. be just another pony in the crowd Enjoying the sunset festival with my friend.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I know i'm just learning about friendship.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I know when we first met, i-it didn't go so well.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I learned the spell years ago when i needed to make copies Of a certain.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I mean, we've known each other practically forever.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I promise i won't let you down.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I promised twilight i'd handle this her way. So thanks but, no thanks.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I really like kites.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I should probably get somepony to cover my student counseling Duties while we're gone.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I switched the trail of plants around To lure the maulwurf here.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I think he might have to kick pharynx out.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I think you might be biased.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I thought ember helped you get more assertive so you could deal with all the renegade changelings Who didn't want to change?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I thought if i just kept wowing you With my magical abilities, you might just, not, notice.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I thought that fluttershy and i could work with the animals Right here in the foyer.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I told twilight i'd run her school right.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I want to hear if you find anything interesting In that barrel.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I wondered how long you'd take To get tired of pillow fort pouting.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I would like a sandwich. oh, no. what should we do?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I'd like to apologize for that.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I'll bring snacks.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I'll get the streamers and the chafing dish.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I'll help you set up your.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I'll judge a book by its cover just this once.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I'll leave you guys to it.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I'll read them too. then we'll all discuss afterward.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I'm a little surprised, myself.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I'm all for pushing the envelope, obviously, But this is pretty out there for you twilight.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I'm coming with you.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I'm gonna pretend that made sense.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I'm gonna tell you what you did wrong.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I'm pretty sure we can skip that.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I'm so glad i'm a pony. are you like, bugs or what?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I'm so glad the two of you are spending time together.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I'm sorry.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I'm starlight glimmer nice to meet you, I've heard great things.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I'm sure a smart and capable student like you Can figure out the solution to any problem over the break.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I'm sure.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_I've got you covered.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_If you master this spell before the girls get back, You'd be setting some kind of record.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_If you want the good stuff, we gotta go to town.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Is everything ok?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Is this true?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_It is a lot harder than i thought.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_It looked like starswirl cast a spell That banished the pony of shadows.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_It might be better if the castle was empty, If you know what i mean.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_It says you have a few public appearances.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_It seems some in our midst might be, dissatisfied with the village life.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_It was a challenge.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_It was supposed to be tea cakes but, it's a long story.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_It'll be a good friends book club, ok?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_It's amazing to think one of the greatest mysteries of equestria Was solved with a musty old book from an antique shop.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_It's her.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_It's like twelve steps away.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_It's my magic that makes all this possible.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_It's perfect.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_It's the perfect solution!
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_It's uh, starlight glimmer.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_It's your choice.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_It's, good to see all of you too.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Just a little something i made up.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Just remember how you'd feel If someone said those things to you.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Just so we can be sure your intentions are, indeed, pure.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Lemme tell you all about it, see, The first thing you should do is.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Let's go, we have to stop this.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Magic props, brainwashed crowds.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Magic?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Manifesto.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Maud does have a way of making rocks really interesting But, i wanted to work on something a little more, us.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Maud isn't super chatty. I mean, you and i could sit around and talk all day, But, she looks pretty busy.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Maybe i can help. i'm pretty good at organizing stuff.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Maybe it'll be long gone And we'll find pharynx out here alone.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Maybe it's not the best cake, But we made it together, and that's what counts.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Maybe that will jog your memory.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Maybe there's another way.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Maybe we should start with something smaller.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Maybe we should, Try something new?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Me too, but since there's literally no room at the inns, I guess it's lucky we've got the wagon.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_More sand than stone, apparently.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Neither of you believes your sister knows How hard it is to be you.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Nice to meet you.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Nice to meet you.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_No doubt you will be as well.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_No matter what.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_No one would ever tease anyone there.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_No way.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_No, i mean, i could help. you could start the trick and right before you got chewed up.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Nope, twilight picked me for the job.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Nope. i am great.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Nopony ever invited you to the school.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Not gonna happen.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Nothing is going to take me away from this party.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Now is your chance to show what changelings can really be.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Now it's time for class,, And don't forget, this afternoon is the spellvenger hunt!
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Now smolder, i understand the school Can be a bit drafty, but that doesn't mean You can breathe fire anywhere you want.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Now we both have plenty of room And you didn't even have to give anything away.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Now, vice headmare discord, if you'll help me get this Spellvenger hunt back in order.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Now, what's next on twilight's list?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Obviously, i need to be available to my students.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Of course you did.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Of course! in a world where everypony is unique, Some are bound to feel more special than others.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Oh no, it might make me thirsty, And we don't have anything to drink, so.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, i just assumed chillaxing could happen anywhere.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, i know. but she always calms down. eventually.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, i was just reminding these two colts How hurtful teasing can be.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, i-i totally am.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, indeed. that's what so unique about our village, you see.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, it is on. where do we begin?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, of course! fiducia compelus needs a trigger.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, oh that's cool, H-how do you.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, that's not true. i convinced them Not to be bullies because everypony should be equal.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, twilight, I-it's not your fault.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, we don't have to wait for that.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, well, it looks like you're really narrowing it down.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, what are you all doing here?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, yeah.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, you don't need me to decide that. Whatever you think is probably best.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Oh. got it.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Oh. ok. well, i'm here to help. my door's always open.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Oh. well, sunburst and i were just catching up, so.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Oh. yeah.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Ok trixie, what kind of spells did you want to work on next?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Ok, friendship one oh one.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Ok, i'll go first.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Ok, so maybe they are having a hard time with it.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Ok. we'd better start moving if we want to make it To the crystal empire.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Ok. why don't we just split up these jobs?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Ok. would you excuse me?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_One, genuine, sweet apple acres apple tree!
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Only, they did it more you know, regally.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Ooh! speaking of.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Or the talents that come with them.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Or, thorax and i can talk about it, and come up With a solution that works for everypony.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Or, we could go over some nice, friendly talking points.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Out of the question!
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Pinkie i don't have a closet.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Pinkie pie i like maud.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Plus, i couldn't really sleep.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Princess celestia, does it bother you that luna never Notices the wonderful breakfasts that you prepare for her?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Princess luna, tell celestia how you feel about the fact.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Rainbow dash never stops talking about Daring do adventures, And you're a huge fan of shadow spade mysteries.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Rarity, applejack, you two can set up in the library.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Ready for the town hall?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Redesigning the hive.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Right. got it.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Same old sunburst.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Second thoughts? pff, Are you kidding?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_See? if twilight isn't stressed, You've got nothing to worry about.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Seriously thorax, What is up with your brother?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_She accepts me for who i am.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_She never told me about a project.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_She sees the world in a totally different way Than any pony i've ever met.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_She's been in there a long time.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_She's pretty great.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Silverstream, there are a lot of students Who want to see me today.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_So how's the whole ruling a kingdom thing going?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_So somepony better come up with something.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_So was i when you met me.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_So, both princesses are hurting each other without realizing it.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_So, how's it going?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_So, i think luna may be hurting her sister's feelings.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_So, the map is probably in the last place You were thinking of. where was that?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_So, this was real!
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_So, tomorrow i thought.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_So, with your help i figure These should be done in no time.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Something important.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Sorry about wasting bits on street food.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Sorry to interfere but, you both.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Sorry to interrupt miss cheerilee.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Sorry, listening.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Starlight, glimmer.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Stay here, i'll get the others.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Still, i'm glad we tried.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Store openings, judging the royal rose contest, you know That sort of thing.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Sunburst and i did everything together.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Sunburst?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Sure it is.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Sure, being counselor for the students At twilight's school of friendship is demanding.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Sure, that was a really, really bad way To try to help your friends.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Tell you what, you take care of the cake, And i'll look for maud.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Terramar and i will check the school.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Thank goodness we're not twilight or the others, They'd probably sing a song about it.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Thank you so much for breakfast princess.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_That all sounds wonderful, but um.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_That doesn't mean you did anything wrong.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_That doesn't seem like a good idea.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_That i'm going to fail something As simple as baking a cake?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_That looks like a lot of work.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_That's a whole lot of photos, How do you usually organize them?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_That's basically what the princesses did When i said there was a friendship problem.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_That's not entirely true.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_That's ridiculous.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_That's true, and you did get your wings From finishing one of starswirl's spells.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_That's why i didn't say anything.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_The baking. just keep following the instructions In the book until i get back.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_The changelings may not be able to stop it anymore, But pharynx certainly can.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_The dread maulwurf?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_The hive, all the activities.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_The hornwriting's pretty sloppy But it's nowhere near as bad as mine.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_The map has never called me before.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_The perfect way for you two to reconnect as friends, Is to read each other's favorite book.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_The reason the cutie mark crusaders don't go to this School is that, they'd make better teachers than students.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_The trick with an s l k is not to make the spars too heavy.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_There are so many friends to be made once you realize you don't need your cutiemarks.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_There are some friends, who would like to see you.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_There you are, Ok, i just left rarity i-i think she's doing better and.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_There's got to be a spell that.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_There's some pine trees over there!
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_They will. i'm sure ponies all across equestria will.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_They'll finally understand what we're trying to accomplish.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_They're beautiful and strong, but they don't judge you or make you feel less than In any way. i think i'm starting to like rocks too.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Things got a little out of hand last night.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_This is a perfectly normal part of the equalization process for those who haven't.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_This is not good.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_This is your first time at our new school isn't it?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_This throne. if we get into the hive and destroy it, Can we get our magic back?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_This wagon isn't small, it's er, cozy.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_This way!
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Thorax and i are going to show you how to compromise.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Thorax said it's like half bear, half mole, Half raging pile of claws.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Thorax wanted to get out of the castle, I thought coming to town was a really, really great idea.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Thorax, we have something to tell you.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Totally, We get you.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Totally. where is it?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Trixie are you all right?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Trixie, there's plenty of high quality inns To stay at on the way.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Trixie, we're coming to offer thorax Encouragement and support.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Twilight and the others have already left To celebrate the spring solstice in canterlot.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Uh huh. why don't you keep putting these photos In chronological order and when i come back You can give me more, highlights.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Uh look, it may seem like rarity and rainbow dash Don't have that much in common When you try to put it into words.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Uh oh, Somepony's dragon's gonna get trapped.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Uh, that also, sounds like maud.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Uh, you guys are in town, too?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Um why don't we go there?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Um, when were you going to tell me about this?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Unless they used some kind of spell to disappear.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Unless, the most legendary ponies of all time Knew what they were doing, and we shouldn't mess with it.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Until today.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Wait.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_We both love magic and games and jokes, everything, really.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_We can start with baking. then.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_We could use some good friendship tutors on staff.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_We defeated the changelings with no magic at all, They found a new leader, And, they're all kinda, good now.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_We don't get many alicorns around here.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_We have no judgments here in our village.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_We have to find out what's going on.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_We have tons in common.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_We need some kind of, distraction.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_We'll find your sister.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_We'll just use one problem to solve another.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_We'll take good care of the castle while you're gone.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_We're all quite fond of it.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_We're not leaving you!
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_We're spending time right now.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Well, at least you're here now.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Well, great seeing you again. i gotta run a few errands.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Well, i can't do nothing.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Well, i don't know if you're going to remember this, but.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Well, i'd be honored.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Well, i'm looking forward to rehearsing the act With you all night.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Well, i've always found magic is tied to my emotions.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Well, it's his brother out there.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Well, she is the princess of friendship.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Well, your sister doesn't get that luxury.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_What are you talking about?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_What did you mean there's no help?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_What did you tell me never to tell another pony?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_What does your tea cup look like?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_What if the great, and powerful trixie can't.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_What is that?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_What made it even better was getting to play it With all my friends.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_What shape is it? what color?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_What was i saying? oh right.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_What's going on?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_What's wrong?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Whatever i'm feeling fuels whatever i'm doing. And the stronger i'm feeling, the stronger the magic.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_When daring used a vicious cragadile as a raft, and then.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_When the map called you six to my village, It was for a friendship problem.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_When the rest of equestria sees that a princess gave up her cutie mark to join u.,.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_When we were foals, we had more in common than any two ponies in equestria.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Where's pharynx?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Whether than means saving equestria or helping friends With a sunset festival.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Which, teachers did you hire?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_While we work on a locator spell.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Whoa, How long are you staying?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Whoops! sorry rose, but i need a bouquet Of flowering sticks, stat!
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Why do you find rocks so fascinating?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Why not for this?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Why, that sounds delicious.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Wouldn't want to forget the things i just said I'd take care of.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Wow, princess luna.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Wow. uh, ok.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Wow. you can tell that from a line?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Yeah, pretty much.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Yeah, see i was really hoping you'd tell me While i pretended to remember.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Yeah, she's weird.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Yeah, this is weird.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Yeah, um i-i don't know if i can make it.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Yep! Maybe a bit early, but like you said, There's a lot to see in ponyville!
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Yep, that's definitely discord.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Yep. i mean, it's supposed to be all dangerous.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Yes, princess.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_You all go back to the party.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_You all knew the pony of shadows before he became what he is now.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_You bet.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_You both love books.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_You can write your own rules! Because you're doing something new.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_You can't normally. but for our trip, I cast a spell that lets us walk like pegasi.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_You did that for me.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_You didn't know that was gonna happen.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_You do this every night?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_You gave up too easily.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_You get the sticks, i'll get the streamers.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_You got this, starlight.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_You have to step up. and, i have changed. i can handle it.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_You just have to see them in action to understand.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_You know it doesn't work that way.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_You know you're doing your pinkie pie voice, right?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_You know, this probably isn't the safest place For a campout.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_You know, why don't i just, hang onto this?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_You look really familiar, have we met before?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_You made it to the end of the day.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_You might have been unstoppable, but you weren't free to choose.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_You must've been friends so, what happened?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_You need to dispel rumors of timberwolves In the white tail woods.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_You need to put yourselves in one another's shoes.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_You two are pretty similar.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_You'll need to use the artifacts' history To find where they're hidden in the castle.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_You're adorable, but probably not what twilight had in mind.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_You're kidding me.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_You're right, too harsh. let's go with.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_You've been hanging around twilight for too long.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Your wings are so, um, see through.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Yup, that's maud.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_Yup. wow, i still can't believe my friends and i Are getting medals of honor.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_a dangerous day for all of equestria.

Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_get started on those sticks And i'll be right back.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_hearg sylfum se ponhenge, what's that?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_hearth's warming eve is a menace.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_i appreciate it, but you're wrong about trixie.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_i see.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_i was in a hurry. i'll do better next time.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_i-i mean yeah, but that's castle food.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_it's fine. at least we worked it all out.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_it's mostly a day dedicated to presents and candy, isn't it?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_it's pretty obvious this isn't going how twilight hoped.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_last night must have been really hard on her.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_learn and use your skills to better equestria.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_not a day to remember some old story.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_not exactly.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_rarity! just the pony i'm looking for.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_so, what happens next?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_speaking of which.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_that seems a little extreme.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_that's a worthy goal for anypony.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_that's not good.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_this doesn't seem like something Starlight and thorax would do.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_to start, why don't you two Share one thing you liked about each other's books?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_uh, i really enjoyed the part in daring do and the razor of dreams.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_um, Twilight and spike had some boring official paperwork To deal with.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_um, i-i really like this old timey barrel.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_user endemest scield.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_wait a minute.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_we must lay siege to canterlot.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_well we can't stay here, come on!
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_well, there's clean, relaxing, um.
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_what kind of name is that?
Starlight_Neutral_Noisy_you know what Jalapeno red velvet omelettes sound gross i-i just can't.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Actually, now that you can snap your claws And send us absolutely anywhere again, I think i have a better option.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Add baking soda salt and cinnamon.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Ah, right.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Also, we're the only ones here.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_An opportunity to really impress twilight?
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_And he was always there to help me.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_And here, is the staff of sameness.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_And thanks to a simple catadupa levitata spell, We've got water.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_And why are you dressed like that?
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_And, princess luna said i should, tell you all How i was feeling.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Are you sure? i could have sworn There were a couple in there somewhere.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_As you know, speed spells like accelero are not easy.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Baking a cake, check! now on to sewing.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Because you're, you. in a coat hat and glasses.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_But figuring out i could use the map To go to any time or place.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_But it's probably going to be a while Before i try to tackle those friendship lessons again.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_But, by working as a team, we can get them done faster.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Can i get you a comfort pillow? Security blanket? Empathy cocoa?
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Can you make a dress exactly like that one?
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Choose equality as your special talent.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Chrysalis and the changelings are back.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Cogeria persuadere, fiducia.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Did you find a place to chillax rainbow dash?
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Doesn't matter.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Exactly like the one in the book.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Excellent work, double diamond.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Exceptionalism is a lie.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Finally, a pony i can relate to.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Fine.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Free yourself from your cutie mark.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Go relax, have a cup of tea.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Good.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_He always knew just what to do.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_He's a reformed changeling. he's on our side, understand?
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_He, shared love, and now he doesn't need to feed!
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Hey! i wanted to apologize for my behavior earlier.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Home has books, tea, fewer bugs, a roof.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_How do i know you aren't some other changeling Pretending to be thorax?
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_I could use magic to save you, And make you appear in the black box.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_I just don't want to fall behind On my friendship lessons back home.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_I know it's bad that there's a changeling around, But is all this really necessary?
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_I see. well, i'm really quite busy this week.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_I think you can take it from here.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_I thought sunburst and i were the same.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_I was thinking, You said twilight is better than you at everything.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_I wasn't so different from you and twilight helped me change.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_I will be, once i cast a spell to contain my anger in this bottle.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_I wouldn't say mobbed.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'd understand if you wanted to, You know.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm curious, how did the subject of the vault come up?
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_I, need a minute.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_I-i, i was invited. to the sunset festival?
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_If there's one pony in equestria that can save a friendship.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_If thorax is right, then yes.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_If we get separated it might make sense to have a way To make sure we are who we say we are.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_In a medium sized mixing bowl, Beat together eggs, sugar and two teaspoons of vanilla.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_In a minute fluttershy.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Is that about the same time your wings changed?
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_It could be very important to our cause.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_It was one of the great mage metalbrook's nine enchanted items.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_It wasn't difficult to change star swirl's spell, he'd already done the hard part.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Just like it.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Just through here!
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Let's just make sure of that, shall we?
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Let's see. make new friends in ponyville, The friendliest place in equestria.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Looks like you were right after all.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Lucky for her, she's not alone.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Maybe cogeria so they are more, open to suggestion?
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Maybe if i had reversed the fiducia compelus and cogeria.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Maybe not. queen chrysalis only said they took luna and celestia.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Maybe we should come up with a plan first?
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Mix in flour.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_No new friends today, i'm afraid.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Nobody makes friends with a total stress case.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_None of us knew we weren't going to be able to use magic.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Nothing, yet.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Now it's fun.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, i can't. tonight's this incredibly important dinner with twilight.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, with a hint of persuadere to be sure it sticks.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh. you know i think i might have missed the point here.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Ok! ok. i believe you, we don't need the whole speech.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Ok. calm down.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Okay, library, library.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Okay. uh, it seemed more efficient to start with the scrapbooking so we could just get it out of the.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Or maybe i added too much persuadere.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Or maybe not.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Or maybe, cogeria combined with fiducia compelus!
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_She's the only baby they have, twilight.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_So many commitments! i'll try and find some time in my.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_So, how long do we sit quietly?
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Something simple and safe. fiducia compelus?
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Sorry, i know you want to visit your niece as much as possible And i'm excited to see sunburst again.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Sun? check. chairs? check.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_That was a challenge. these? pfft ha!
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_That was, strange.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_That's it! we're not going anywhere Until i get the whole story.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_That's not bad, they would barely notice it But, is it enough?
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_That's what i'm worried about.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_The changeling kingdom. with you on our side.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_The festival lasts a whole week But, i'm sure we won't stay that long.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Then why not put him in charge?
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_This is thorax. he's a reformed changeling.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_This is what happens when you give love freely Instead of taking it.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_This is your last warning.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_This one belongs to a princess.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Thorax is still out there.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_To excel is to fail.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Trixie, this is thorax.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Twilight?
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Two of the changelings didn't go with the rest.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Uh, we're on a schedule. no time for a song.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Unfortunately it's all too true, my friends.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Wait to do a different friendship lesson when we get back.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_We get it, the crystal ponies adore you.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_We hope someday, every pony in equestria will make a pilgrimage here to our little village.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Welcome home, twilight.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, i guess that's that!
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, it seems you inspire all sorts of free thinking, don't you?
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Were they?
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_What did you have in mind rarity?
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_What if you didn't have to?
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_What?
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_When combined with accelero in just the right way.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_When twilight said i should bring a friend, You were the first pony i thought of.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_When we were foals, Sunburst knew everything there was to know about magic.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_When you spot one, touch it with a magic shield To keep track of your score.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Where did they put the library?
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Why should you be any different?
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Won't be needing that any more.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Wouldn't that be nice?
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Wow, this crystalling sounds pretty important.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Wow, you are twilighting hard.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Yeah but, not like that.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_You can be the leader your subjects deserve.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_You could get rid of this junk.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_You may go, double diamond.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_You really think a new outfit will help me meet ponies?
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_You're sure sticking to the book is going to work?
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_Your wings look, different.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_a spirit! i didn't cast any spirit summoning spell.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_and i'm sure you have plenty of important work to do.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_because it's what she does.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_guess i'll, watch the school?
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_i'm just lucky to have such understanding friends.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_is that everything we need to chillax?
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_it's not all about singing and presents.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_nopony's here.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_snowfall doesn't like hearth's warming eve so she decides to cast a spell to get rid of it all together?
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_so, there it is.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_sunburst and i don't have anything in common anyway.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_that doesn't matter now.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_the singing and presents are all about celebrating the ponies in our lives.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_think the baking lesson is done.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_today is nothing to celebrate.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_twi? you in here? with the school closed for the summer i didn't think anypony would be here.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_uh you're spike, spike.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_well, that batch is ruined. snowdash!
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_windigos!? they aren't real.
Starlight_Neutral_Very Noisy_yeah, about that.
Starlight_Neutral__A cockatrice?
Starlight_Neutral__Actually silverstream, i don't.
Starlight_Neutral__Actually, that's exactly what i was going to do.
Starlight_Neutral__After twilight remembered the journal.
Starlight_Neutral__Also, i'll never like camping.
Starlight_Neutral__And i don't think we can.
Starlight_Neutral__And i guess my first instinct shouldn't be to Magically command ponies to act the way i want them to.
Starlight_Neutral__And i no longer control ponies against their will.
Starlight_Neutral__And offer you the job of vice headmare.
Starlight_Neutral__And our lives are so much better for it.
Starlight_Neutral__And yes i know how ridiculous that sounds.
Starlight_Neutral__Anyway, i wanted to talk to all of you.
Starlight_Neutral__Are you kidding? after all you've done for me? This is the least i can do.
Starlight_Neutral__Are you two fighting over this?
Starlight_Neutral__As you both know, the map sent me here for a reason And.
Starlight_Neutral__Because we used to drink so much apple juice as foals.
Starlight_Neutral__Besides, i need to lock up the school for the holiday And it's time you caught the train home.
Starlight_Neutral__But i don't want to be the one to tell thorax that.
Starlight_Neutral__But if done correctly, they can allow you to be Much more efficient with your day.
Starlight_Neutral__But now, trixie has come to terms with being second best.
Starlight_Neutral__But that's not true. you're better at magic.
Starlight_Neutral__But the students are my responsibility.
Starlight_Neutral__But what matters is, you wanted to.
Starlight_Neutral__But whatever she did, you've forgiven her, right?
Starlight_Neutral__But, i learn from them. I think that's what growing up is.
Starlight_Neutral__But, my job doesn't really seem like work.
Starlight_Neutral__Dad i know i've made some mistakes And, i'll probably make a bunch more.
Starlight_Neutral__Did you remember?
Starlight_Neutral__Dinner's tomorrow.
Starlight_Neutral__Don't.
Starlight_Neutral__Each of us was confused once as well.
Starlight_Neutral__Eh, don't push it.
Starlight_Neutral__Find out what you have in common.
Starlight_Neutral__Fixing manes with magic is.
Starlight_Neutral__Fluttershy, stay here.
Starlight_Neutral__Friendship lessons can happen anywhere.
Starlight_Neutral__Fruity.
Starlight_Neutral__Get pharynx and meet me at the hive entrance, I'll explain everything.
Starlight_Neutral__Good choice.
Starlight_Neutral__Got it.
Starlight_Neutral__Great.
Starlight_Neutral__Hard.
Starlight_Neutral__Haven't you learned anything About using magic to solve your problems?
Starlight_Neutral__He's not the only one.
Starlight_Neutral__Heh, yeah that's actually kind of why i'm here.
Starlight_Neutral__Hey spike. what's up?
Starlight_Neutral__His letters make it seem like the responsibilities of being The changeling leader are a little overwhelming.
Starlight_Neutral__Hm.
Starlight_Neutral__Hm. we'll just have to explain to our parents That we're on an important friendship mission, So they can't bother us.
Starlight_Neutral__Hmm. sounds like your mind's made up.
Starlight_Neutral__Hmmm.
Starlight_Neutral__Honestly? We don't know anything about him.
Starlight_Neutral__Hope that's ok.
Starlight_Neutral__How can i help?
Starlight_Neutral__How much is a whole lot?
Starlight_Neutral__I appreciate the history lesson dad, But i need to find the problem now.
Starlight_Neutral__I can see i'm gonna need reinforcements.
Starlight_Neutral__I can't believe you've memorized your lines already, fluttershy.
Starlight_Neutral__I can't choose, i like all your friends.
Starlight_Neutral__I don't know many ponies who are fluent in olde ponish.
Starlight_Neutral__I don't know, but i'm going to find out!
Starlight_Neutral__I don't need every little detail.
Starlight_Neutral__I feel like that's almost good advice.
Starlight_Neutral__I guess my first question would be.
Starlight_Neutral__I had to stop thinking like a headmare and start thinking Like a guidance counselor to finally understand.
Starlight_Neutral__I have a few ideas.
Starlight_Neutral__I just find it all a little, silly.
Starlight_Neutral__I just never really felt the need to.
Starlight_Neutral__I knew it!
Starlight_Neutral__I know from experience that's not always true.
Starlight_Neutral__I know maybe it wasn't the coronation you planned, but it's good to see all of you laughing.
Starlight_Neutral__I know the festival is almost over, but i, kinda invited A few of my friends to join.
Starlight_Neutral__I know there's been a little bit of adjustment Since the professors left for their trip, But i've brought in new new teachers.
Starlight_Neutral__I know! he could help you with her party!
Starlight_Neutral__I may have been a tiny bit.
Starlight_Neutral__I mean, i know you're probably very busy.
Starlight_Neutral__I really messed up.
Starlight_Neutral__I really think you're being too hard on yourself.
Starlight_Neutral__I should have guessed that would backfire.
Starlight_Neutral__I should've just told you i'll never like camping.
Starlight_Neutral__I think to most ponies, it's just an excuse For silly songs and fun.
Starlight_Neutral__I think we can both say that's not a good option.
Starlight_Neutral__I traded the old, worn out wagon that was too small for us.
Starlight_Neutral__I was just about to say the same thing.
Starlight_Neutral__I'll forgive you if you forgive me.
Starlight_Neutral__I'm glad you all got past my first impression.
Starlight_Neutral__I'm gonna stop talking now.
Starlight_Neutral__I'm not from here either. i've been trying to make friends But, it's not easy.
Starlight_Neutral__I'm sorry too.
Starlight_Neutral__I've always been something of a natural.
Starlight_Neutral__I've got an idea!
Starlight_Neutral__I, have a cake to bake.
Starlight_Neutral__If it's just you, me and princess celestia, Why are there four seats?
Starlight_Neutral__If we made copies of ourselves, We could get a year's worth of hanging out over in one day.
Starlight_Neutral__Imagine doing sweaty warm ups with a princess.
Starlight_Neutral__It wasn't great.
Starlight_Neutral__It's allright, everypony.
Starlight_Neutral__Just sum up the story in one sentence.
Starlight_Neutral__Klutzy draconequus. works for me.
Starlight_Neutral__Klutzy.
Starlight_Neutral__Let's just hope he stays gone.
Starlight_Neutral__Let's just say i learned a friendship lesson While you were gone.
Starlight_Neutral__Let's pick something, i don't know, not living.
Starlight_Neutral__Like you?
Starlight_Neutral__Maybe i could be your, magic show helper pony?
Starlight_Neutral__Maybe not.
Starlight_Neutral__Maybe we could talk to him for you.
Starlight_Neutral__Maybe we don't have to.
Starlight_Neutral__Maybe you just need to spend more time with him.
Starlight_Neutral__Mine's more of a glimmer.
Starlight_Neutral__Mm hm!
Starlight_Neutral__Mm hmm.
Starlight_Neutral__My papa wasn't called by the map in twilight's castle, i was.
Starlight_Neutral__Nah. you just taught me the value of friendship.
Starlight_Neutral__Next time you want something, just ask for it, all right?
Starlight_Neutral__No idea.
Starlight_Neutral__No!
Starlight_Neutral__Nope!
Starlight_Neutral__Nope, it's just me, reading.
Starlight_Neutral__Nopony, i just did it.
Starlight_Neutral__Not everything.
Starlight_Neutral__Not if you could use real magic.
Starlight_Neutral__Not much at all.
Starlight_Neutral__Not today, it didn't.
Starlight_Neutral__Not unless we solved a friendship problem every few Seconds, and i kinda hope this one will be it for a while.
Starlight_Neutral__Not without you.
Starlight_Neutral__Nothing.
Starlight_Neutral__Now that i think about it, there isn't a pony in all of equestria I have more in common with.
Starlight_Neutral__Now that's the twilight i know.
Starlight_Neutral__Now, i'm finished.
Starlight_Neutral__Now, we just need to find you something to teleport.
Starlight_Neutral__Of course he does.
Starlight_Neutral__Of course!
Starlight_Neutral__Of course.
Starlight_Neutral__Oh that's too bad. i love a good conversation.
Starlight_Neutral__Oh! it's only a dream.
Starlight_Neutral__Oh, i heard set the table and just kinda went for it.
Starlight_Neutral__Oh, i just did what anypony would've done.
Starlight_Neutral__Oh. thanks.
Starlight_Neutral__Ok, so we wanted to talk to all of you, you know, in private.
Starlight_Neutral__Ok, what you want to do is concentrate on the object That you want to teleport.
Starlight_Neutral__Ok. tell me about this one.
Starlight_Neutral__Or, they want to see you now.
Starlight_Neutral__Party favor, would you join us, please?
Starlight_Neutral__Perhaps it would be easier to understand If i gave you a tour of the village.
Starlight_Neutral__Pinkie pie gave me her recipe and everything.
Starlight_Neutral__Pinkie, kitchen. rarity, applejack, library.
Starlight_Neutral__Rainbow dash, find somewhere inside the castle And set up a place where we can chillax.
Starlight_Neutral__Really?
Starlight_Neutral__Right now, i'm sort of twilight sparkle's new pupil.
Starlight_Neutral__Right.
Starlight_Neutral__She probably just found a new rock formation And forgot you two were gonna hang out.
Starlight_Neutral__She taught me that a rock is never just a rock And, she can make anything funny.
Starlight_Neutral__She's just like me, we have a real connection.
Starlight_Neutral__She's making a point. we get it.
Starlight_Neutral__She's your mentor.
Starlight_Neutral__She's.
Starlight_Neutral__Should i, change it back?
Starlight_Neutral__Similo duplexus.
Starlight_Neutral__Since you're moving away, we thought if you missed any of us or Ponyville, this might help.
Starlight_Neutral__So does maud.
Starlight_Neutral__So they'll never find out princess celestia is a bad actress.
Starlight_Neutral__So we can't hold the books?
Starlight_Neutral__So we left. very suddenly. in a literal puff of smoke.
Starlight_Neutral__So, not a big fan of the vines, huh?
Starlight_Neutral__So, other than rocks, what else are you into?
Starlight_Neutral__So, we're just going to wait in line for hours?
Starlight_Neutral__So, what are all the things we have to do?
Starlight_Neutral__So, you're probably wondering why i'm back so soon.
Starlight_Neutral__Somewhere you can't hurt anypony.
Starlight_Neutral__Sorry I'm so late. I actually thought I'd missed you.
Starlight_Neutral__Sorry.
Starlight_Neutral__Sorry.
Starlight_Neutral__Such backwards thinking.
Starlight_Neutral__Such, selfishness!
Starlight_Neutral__Sunburst and i were called here to do a job, And it looks like you two are it.
Starlight_Neutral__Teleportation spell.
Starlight_Neutral__Thanks spike.
Starlight_Neutral__Thanks, all of you.
Starlight_Neutral__That she never acknowledges the work You put into lining the hallway With lavender every night.
Starlight_Neutral__That's a good idea.
Starlight_Neutral__That's crazy.
Starlight_Neutral__That's different.
Starlight_Neutral__That's fair.
Starlight_Neutral__That's kind of a mouthful.
Starlight_Neutral__That's not how twilight teaches friendship.
Starlight_Neutral__That's way more important than some, friendship lesson.
Starlight_Neutral__The princesses aren't the best at communicating With each other.
Starlight_Neutral__The thing is, it's pretty much like zecora said.
Starlight_Neutral__Then i have just one thing to say to you.
Starlight_Neutral__They might not get each other.
Starlight_Neutral__They're just focusing on the wrong things.
Starlight_Neutral__This castle looked a lot smaller from the outside.
Starlight_Neutral__This shop looked a lot smaller from the outside.
Starlight_Neutral__Those were formal things, galas, world saving.
Starlight_Neutral__Throne room, got it!
Starlight_Neutral__Trixie, do have any idea how to find a cockatrice?
Starlight_Neutral__Twilight wants to use you as an example for the students.
Starlight_Neutral__Ugh! this is all my fault.
Starlight_Neutral__Uh, disguise or not spike, i don't think you need to worry About being mobbed.
Starlight_Neutral__Uh, i'll catch up. i think there's something in my hoof.
Starlight_Neutral__Uh, what are we supposed to do first?
Starlight_Neutral__Um, i feel, like i don't want to talk about feelings?
Starlight_Neutral__Um, i've been with you singing and standing in line.
Starlight_Neutral__Usually, twilight or one of our other friends gets called To a place with a friendship problem to fix.
Starlight_Neutral__Wait here!
Starlight_Neutral__Wait.
Starlight_Neutral__Want to break it to applejack for me?
Starlight_Neutral__Was it that bad at sweet apple acres?
Starlight_Neutral__We can fix this campsite in no time.
Starlight_Neutral__We know a thing or two about what it's like to be outsiders.
Starlight_Neutral__We wanted to surprise you.
Starlight_Neutral__Well maybe they'll like each other?
Starlight_Neutral__Well you did say anypony and i just assumed That you'd trust me to make my own friends The way princess celestia trusted you.
Starlight_Neutral__Well, i couldn't ask for more than that.
Starlight_Neutral__Well, i figured after magic school You'd go on to do important wizard work, but.
Starlight_Neutral__Well, maud obviously likes something about him.
Starlight_Neutral__Well, nothing when you say it like that.
Starlight_Neutral__Well, we haven't actually solved it.
Starlight_Neutral__Well.
Starlight_Neutral__What about that unicorn? The one who attacked canterlot?
Starlight_Neutral__What are you doing?
Starlight_Neutral__What did you tell me to never, tell another pony you said?
Starlight_Neutral__What is it?
Starlight_Neutral__What is it?
Starlight_Neutral__What's a wonderbolt?
Starlight_Neutral__What?
Starlight_Neutral__When will it be ready?
Starlight_Neutral__Who's that?
Starlight_Neutral__Window staring, huh?
Starlight_Neutral__Without even realizing it.
Starlight_Neutral__Wow! maud has a boyfriend?
Starlight_Neutral__Wow, i almost feel bad eating this.
Starlight_Neutral__Wow, trixie was right.
Starlight_Neutral__Yeah i see your point.
Starlight_Neutral__Yeah yeah yeah sure.
Starlight_Neutral__Yeah, i do that.
Starlight_Neutral__Yeah, maybe we don't need the raft.
Starlight_Neutral__Yeah.
Starlight_Neutral__Yeah. We needed to focus, b-but we're definitely not avoiding them.
Starlight_Neutral__Yeah. i guess after the way i used my magic on all of you, i wasn't sure i was somepony who should even be in charge Of a baking contest.
Starlight_Neutral__Yes, but.
Starlight_Neutral__Yona is having the worst time with her braids lately.
Starlight_Neutral__You and me doing the stuff we like, games, magic.
Starlight_Neutral__You both care about maud.
Starlight_Neutral__You don't happen to know where the library is, do you?
Starlight_Neutral__You ever have one of those days?
Starlight_Neutral__You felt left out.
Starlight_Neutral__You know how someponies say nothing's wrong But you can tell something's definitely wrong?
Starlight_Neutral__You shouldn't underestimate yourself.
Starlight_Neutral__You want to help?
Starlight_Neutral__You're an aunt now.
Starlight_Neutral__You're messing with me.
Starlight_Neutral__You're not a princess princess.
Starlight_Neutral__Your secret's safe with me.
Starlight_Neutral__actually, we might.
Starlight_Neutral__as your pupil.
Starlight_Neutral__but, I realized that sometimes you don't have a choice.
Starlight_Neutral__do you know a lot about rocks?
Starlight_Neutral__every foal and filly knows that story.
Starlight_Neutral__good job, trix, but i was baking these to give To twilight and the girls for their friendship retreat.
Starlight_Neutral__i can't think of anypony more qualified.
Starlight_Neutral__i cast a spell on the door to my office So this bracelet goes off whenever there's a knock.
Starlight_Neutral__i guess i'm not exactly thrilled with the options.
Starlight_Neutral__i know, right? it's not like there's some spell that would magically compel us to pick up where we left off.
Starlight_Neutral__i think twilight would be proud of us.
Starlight_Neutral__i was thinking i might just skip it.
Starlight_Neutral__it doesn't mean anything. it's just stuff.
Starlight_Neutral__just, promise you'll stay in touch?
Starlight_Neutral__never mind.
Starlight_Neutral__not much need for a guidance counselor At a school of friendship.
Starlight_Neutral__nuh uh.
Starlight_Neutral__oh He will, but first how about we grab a bite to eat?
Starlight_Neutral__oh, that's the students' treehouse. Apparently it grew from the tree of harmony and.
Starlight_Neutral__once the spell is cast, all of equestria will be better off.
Starlight_Neutral__so looks like you and i get to hang out. What would you like to do?
Starlight_Neutral__so, what did you want to talk to me about?
Starlight_Neutral__sunburst?
Starlight_Neutral__that's worse. what i'm trying to say.
Starlight_Neutral__they're not saying it, But i think everypony knows about my past.
Starlight_Neutral__twilight just said how impressed she was That i combined a speed spell and a duplication spell.
Starlight_Neutral__um, don't you mean present, like, the time?
Starlight_Neutral__why not.
Starlight_Neutral__yeah. great.
Starlight_Sad Angry__Glad i was so entertaining for you.
Starlight_Sad Annoyed_Noisy_I guess i'm lucky your idol wasn't around When you decided to be my friend.
Starlight_Sad Annoyed_Noisy_I might've been banished to limbo too.
Starlight_Sad Annoyed_Noisy_and then getting so bitter that you steal the cutie marks from an entire village, and then get defeated by twilight and her friends.
Starlight_Sad Annoyed_Noisy_so you travel through time to get back at them, but they beat you again and teach you about friendship.
Starlight_Sad Annoyed__Why couldn't we have been sent to stop a war or something?
Starlight_Sad Annoyed__but, you're so terrified ponies will find out what you did That you can't make any friends!
Starlight_Sad Anxious_Noisy_Except apparently when it matters.
Starlight_Sad Anxious_Noisy_It's like you don't even care You could get me in a lot of trouble.
Starlight_Sad Anxious_Noisy_Not great.
Starlight_Sad Anxious_Noisy_This is all my fault.
Starlight_Sad Anxious_Noisy_Um, goodnight.
Starlight_Sad Anxious_Noisy_You lost twilight's map table.
Starlight_Sad Anxious_Noisy_You make jokes like it's no big deal.
Starlight_Sad Anxious_Noisy_i-i know. i'm sorry. i shouldn't have forgotten.
Starlight_Sad Anxious_Noisy_it's not the list, spike. or you. or twilight.
Starlight_Sad Anxious__I came back early because i freaked out.
Starlight_Sad Anxious__I guess that makes sense.
Starlight_Sad Anxious__I know, but i don't want her to think i'm not ready to learn,.
Starlight_Sad Anxious__I promised to help her today And i haven't done a single thing!
Starlight_Sad Anxious__I've been cleaning up the mess i made By totally failing at friendship.
Starlight_Sad Anxious__It was kind of a disaster.
Starlight_Sad Anxious__my dad treats me like a filly. Like nothing's changed since i was a foal.
Starlight_Sad Sarcastic_Noisy_I'll just, go dust my office for the seventieth time.
Starlight_Sad Sarcastic_Noisy_Of course it is.
Starlight_Sad_Noisy_And bodies.
Starlight_Sad_Noisy_And even though it turned out all right, Things could have been a lot worse.
Starlight_Sad_Noisy_And just like that, my friend was gone.
Starlight_Sad_Noisy_Because he's right about one thing, I've been doing a terrible job as headmare.
Starlight_Sad_Noisy_But i want you all to know that I'm ready for whatever punishment you think is fair.
Starlight_Sad_Noisy_But i wonder why me being in charge bothers him so much.
Starlight_Sad_Noisy_But it seems pretty clear that sunburst and i have grown apart.
Starlight_Sad_Noisy_But now it seems like he's got more in common With my friends than he does with me.
Starlight_Sad_Noisy_But the busy and distracted starlight sure doesn't.
Starlight_Sad_Noisy_His family recognised his magical talent and sent him off to canterlot.
Starlight_Sad_Noisy_I just wish i hadn't abandoned her In the first place.
Starlight_Sad_Noisy_I know there's no excuse for what i did.
Starlight_Sad_Noisy_I know.
Starlight_Sad_Noisy_I might as well have.
Starlight_Sad_Noisy_I should have known. nopony else in ponyville Wanted to be my friend. why would you?
Starlight_Sad_Noisy_I think pharynx is a lost cause.
Starlight_Sad_Noisy_I thought so too, but it hasn't worked out that way.
Starlight_Sad_Noisy_I'm afraid to go back to the village for the celebration.
Starlight_Sad_Noisy_I'm just not sure sunburst wants to stay friends too.
Starlight_Sad_Noisy_I'm not so sure.
Starlight_Sad_Noisy_I've been avoiding the friendship lessons on purpose.
Starlight_Sad_Noisy_Not great actually. you're probably wondering Why i'm back from the village so early.
Starlight_Sad_Noisy_Now if you'll excuse me, i've got to go clean the castle Covered in wet cake batter and spiders.
Starlight_Sad_Noisy_Oh, i guess ghastly gorge really does have The best rocks.
Starlight_Sad_Noisy_Reuniting me with my first friend.
Starlight_Sad_Noisy_Studying new rocks with maud?
Starlight_Sad_Noisy_Ta da. friendship lesson, learned?
Starlight_Sad_Noisy_They're not. i am.
Starlight_Sad_Noisy_You're here so i guess you two aren't off.
Starlight_Sad_Noisy_aw thanks, spike. at least i have two friends, even if one of them has dragon breath.
Starlight_Sad_Noisy_translating Some ancient olde ponish text.
Starlight_Sad_Very Noisy_But when he left.
Starlight_Sad_Very Noisy_I guess it's not surprising that sunburst Got his cutie mark in magic and.
Starlight_Sad_Very Noisy_I'm sorry your saddle arabian tour was ruined.
Starlight_Sad_Very Noisy_Went off to princess celestia's school.
Starlight_Sad_Very Noisy_What was i thinking? I'm never going with my gut again!
Starlight_Sad_Very Noisy_he didn't have to say it.
Starlight_Sad_Very Noisy_i was wrong earlier. about hearth's warming eve.
Starlight_Sad_Very Noisy_i'm the one sunburst doesn't want to be friends with.
Starlight_Sad_Very Noisy_the ponies we should, listen to more often. our friends.
Starlight_Sad_Very Noisy_well spike, looks like my biggest fears came true.
Starlight_Sad__Actually, i think sunburst and i figured out what it is.
Starlight_Sad__After everything i did.
Starlight_Sad__Believe me i know.
Starlight_Sad__But i guess we don't even have that anymore.
Starlight_Sad__Dad?
Starlight_Sad__I didn't want to be a disappointment to anypony And, i ended up being a disappointment to everypony.
Starlight_Sad__I guess you two weren't the problem We were sent to solve after all.
Starlight_Sad__I kind of freaked out and ran out of the village.
Starlight_Sad__I know first hoof how true that can be.
Starlight_Sad__I know, I'm a horrible daughter.
Starlight_Sad__I know.
Starlight_Sad__I never saw him again.
Starlight_Sad__I'm sorry i've been avoiding coming home dad.
Starlight_Sad__In fact, i don't remember us ever being apart.
Starlight_Sad__Maybe.
Starlight_Sad__No.
Starlight_Sad__Things didn't go the way i thought they were going to go At the sunset festival.
Starlight_Sad__Yep. home.
Starlight_Sad__You're right to be upset, and i hope one day, I can make it up to you.
Starlight_Sad__and no thought to the pain you cause your friends?
Starlight_Sad__but, all i can say is, i'm sorry.
Starlight_Sad__i was afraid i might go back To being the pony i used to be.
Starlight_Sad__i was trying to have fun doing the one thing I thought we still had in common.
Starlight_Sad__let's just say, i know what it's like to have something you're not exactly proud of.
Starlight_Sad__not become totally evil?
Starlight_Sarcastic Annoyed_Noisy_Really? because if you wanted to make things more comfortable, You could always.
Starlight_Sarcastic_Noisy_Ha ha ha ha. ya think?
Starlight_Sarcastic_Noisy_Not help pharynx and he won't bother you anymore.
Starlight_Sarcastic_Noisy_Now i'll alphabetize them in reverse order.
Starlight_Sarcastic_Noisy_Oh, sure, you could all stay here.
Starlight_Sarcastic_Noisy_So diligent of you to go over it and over it in your sleep.
Starlight_Sarcastic_Noisy_oops.
Starlight_Sarcastic_Noisy_yay.
Starlight_Sarcastic_Very Noisy_Oh, isn't it a shame we don't live in A world where everypony is equal?
Starlight_Sarcastic_Very Noisy_Yup. thanks for bringing that up.
Starlight_Sarcastic_Very Noisy_but by all means, if you want to go home early, ignore all of the work you have.
Starlight_Sarcastic__Did he though?!
Starlight_Sarcastic__Gee, thanks for believing in me, twilight.
Starlight_Sarcastic__Gee. i don't know.
Starlight_Sarcastic__Great, well.
Starlight_Sarcastic__Great.
Starlight_Sarcastic__Great. thanks for asking in a completely not creepy way.
Starlight_Sarcastic__Hey, maybe i'll just force friendships By magically enslaving the entire population Of ponyville!
Starlight_Sarcastic__Oh yeah, real motivating!
Starlight_Sarcastic__Very funny, applejack. Still me under all this gear, starlight.
Starlight_Sarcastic__You're the greatest camper in the history of equestria.
Starlight_Shouting_Noisy_Not because you have to, but because you choose to!
Starlight_Shouting_Very Noisy_Enough!
Starlight_Shouting_Very Noisy_Twilight!
Starlight_Smug Amused_Noisy_i'm not going anywhere.
Starlight_Smug Angry_Very Noisy_Without the rainboom, you and your friends Will never form your special cutie mark bonds!
Starlight_Smug Angry_Very Noisy_Without the rainboom, you and your friends will Never form your special cutie mark bonds!
Starlight_Smug Sarcastic_Noisy_Oh, next i suppose you'll tell me that The fate of all of equestria hangs in the balance!
Starlight_Smug Sarcastic_Noisy_You'd all still be living your miserable lives, thinking you're better then everypony else.
Starlight_Smug Sarcastic_Very Noisy_Gee, twilight, what's the matter? Couldn't convince her to do the impossible? That's too bad.
Starlight_Smug Sarcastic__Oh, a pity.
Starlight_Smug_Noisy_Ah ha! you still don't trust me!
Starlight_Smug_Noisy_And you're quite certain it was only you?
Starlight_Smug_Noisy_Ha! and so do you. see what i did there? You just said everything you need to hear.
Starlight_Smug_Noisy_I trust you had a pleasant night?
Starlight_Smug_Noisy_If you say so!
Starlight_Smug_Noisy_Maybe you did your spell wrong?
Starlight_Smug_Noisy_Nonsense! Obviously these ponies must have asked you directly.
Starlight_Smug_Noisy_Quite seen the light yet.
Starlight_Smug_Noisy_So, apparently a conversation can save equestria?
Starlight_Smug_Noisy_Stopping the rainboom is just a bonus.
Starlight_Smug_Noisy_Welcome home, twilight.
Starlight_Smug_Very Noisy_And pull you along with me? I even impressed myself with that.
Starlight_Smug_Very Noisy_And we'll teach you just how better life can be without your cutie marks!
Starlight_Smug_Very Noisy_Aww, sorry about this.
Starlight_Smug_Very Noisy_But stopping her's gonna be harder than you think.
Starlight_Smug_Very Noisy_I could combine all five of these at the same time Without breaking a sweat.
Starlight_Smug_Very Noisy_I don't blame you for what you tried to do here today.
Starlight_Smug_Very Noisy_I knew you'd try to stop me, you're so predictable.
Starlight_Smug_Very Noisy_I'd tell you, but i don't want to ruin the surprise!
Starlight_Smug_Very Noisy_Let's see how they like spending the rest of their lives without their precious cutiemarks.
Starlight_Smug_Very Noisy_Now, there's one more order of business.
Starlight_Smug_Very Noisy_Oh, good morning.
Starlight_Smug_Very Noisy_See? you can't stop me no matter what you do.
Starlight_Smug_Very Noisy_So even when you cast it, i still get sent back here.
Starlight_Smug_Very Noisy_So, do any of you have anything you'd like to say?
Starlight_Smug_Very Noisy_Sorry to disappoint you, but i created that spell To send myself back in time.
Starlight_Smug_Very Noisy_This time, i'm not using magic.
Starlight_Smug_Very Noisy_Touching it triggered the map to whisk you here, And watch me erase the one thing that link you with your friends.
Starlight_Smug_Very Noisy_Up for another race ending fight, twilight?
Starlight_Smug_Very Noisy_We'll try again tomorrow, Once you have a bit more, time, to consider our philosophy.
Starlight_Smug_Very Noisy_Well, finding her will be easy!
Starlight_Smug_Very Noisy_Well, good luck!
Starlight_Smug_Very Noisy_Well, now you can spend the rest of your lives here, with us!
Starlight_Smug_Very Noisy_Why else would i leave the scroll behind?
Starlight_Smug_Very Noisy_Will you kindly tell us the names of those friends who so desperately miss they cutiemarks That they would, sneak around in the shadows talking to strangers about it?
Starlight_Smug_Very Noisy_You've really gotta work on your aim.
Starlight_Smug_Very Noisy_You've spent your whole lives thinking those marks are a good thing.
Starlight_Smug_Very Noisy_You, are about to find out.
Starlight_Smug_Very Noisy_i've got a spell to cast. and i don't need a history lesson about hearth's warming eve.
Starlight_Smug_Very Noisy_now you can spend the rest of your lives here.
Starlight_Smug_Very Noisy_without your cutie marks.
Starlight_Smug__I told you i could do it.
Starlight_Smug__If that's what it takes to keep you and your friends From getting your cutie mark connection, then i'm game!
Starlight_Smug__Not bad, but it's gonna take a lot more than that.
Starlight_Smug__Put it on my tab.
Starlight_Smug__When it comes to magic, i don't make mistakes.
Starlight_Smug__well, let's try this again tomorrow, shall we?
Starlight_Surprised Anxious_Noisy_Huh?

Stellar Flare_Happy__I might have a few plans for that.
Stellar Flare_Happy__In the future, all ponies will drink their fruit.
Stellar Flare_Happy__We really are providing excellent assistance, aren't we?
Stellar Flare_Neutral_Noisy_Finally. Now, i know you don't want me to make up a problem, but, what if i start one?
Stellar Flare_Neutral_Noisy_I mean, no pony ever became a success by following All the rules, right?
Stellar Flare_Neutral_Noisy_Step one, interview the suspects.
Stellar Flare_Neutral_Noisy_Step three, get the princess of friendship To send you on more missions.
Stellar Flare_Neutral__A clear plan for the future.
Stellar Flare_Neutral__After this success, i'm sure the princess of friendship Will want to send you on more missions.
Stellar Flare_Neutral__Already got one.
Stellar Flare_Neutral__And i might have been trying to turn the town into a shopping mall.
Stellar Flare_Neutral__And i've got plans for this little town.
Stellar Flare_Neutral__Big plans.
Stellar Flare_Neutral__How are things on your end?
Stellar Flare_Neutral__How are you going to explain this to the princess?
Stellar Flare_Neutral__I don't suppose there's a way for you To get it to glow all the time?
Stellar Flare_Neutral__I remember how lost you were When you, flunked out of magic school.
Stellar Flare_Neutral__I said, firelight, you're crazy.
Stellar Flare_Neutral__I thought, as long as you had a plan, You'd never feel that way again.
Stellar Flare_Neutral__Now you've had a little setback but don't worry. I know exactly what you need to do.
Stellar Flare_Neutral__Ok it's annoying, i get it.
Stellar Flare_Neutral__Our village needs the same thing you do, sunburst.
Stellar Flare_Neutral__Step two, use your talents to solve the issue.
Stellar Flare_Neutral__Sunburst, you should move closer to ponyville.
Stellar Flare_Neutral__That's exactly what i told him.
Stellar Flare_Neutral__That's lovely of you to say dear, but you know, I can always visit you.
Stellar Flare_Neutral__That's right. Neither of you have been home in ages. You're going to need our help to succeed.
Stellar Flare_Neutral__That's why i started the sires hollow development committee.
Stellar Flare_Neutral__The glowing cutie mark is such a symbol of accomplishment.
Stellar Flare_Neutral__Use your words sunburst.
Stellar Flare_Neutral__Well i'll hear what you have to say, But every plan i've made for this town is perfectly reasonable.
Stellar Flare_Neutral__Well, it's going to take more than an apology to.
Stellar Flare_Neutral__What's your plan if she fires you from friendship quests?
Stellar Flare_Neutral__You mean, your success, depends on us?
Stellar Flare_Neutral__make up for telling me you don't want my help Finding your friendship problem.
Stellar Flare_Neutral__sunburst!
Stellar Flare_Sad__Well, i'm, sorry for trying to help!
Stellar Flare_Sarcastic__Oh, did you come by to be driven crazy By, more of your mother's plans?

Stygian_Neutral_Noisy_I went to ponehenge to make my own copies of the artifacts.

Sugar Belle_Neutral__He's a pony of few words, I love that about him.
Sugar Belle_Neutral__I have to get some flowers to spruce the place up.
Sugar Belle_Neutral__I just wish i had more room to display it all.
Sugar Belle_Neutral__I know i'm not a very good baker.

Sugar Belle_Neutral__My shelves only hold so much.
Sugar Belle_Neutral__Now you three go deliver that pie.
Sugar Belle_Neutral__Oh, big mac.
Sugar Belle_Neutral__She wants us all to be happy in our sameness.
Sugar Belle_Neutral__So nopony could see what's about to happen.
Sugar Belle_Neutral__So, I thought I'd use as many words as possible to propose to him!
Sugar Belle_Neutral__So, he'll be fine right?
Sugar Belle_Neutral__Sure. One.
Sugar Belle_Neutral__Talking instead of assuming or, eavesdropping is wrong.
Sugar Belle_Neutral__That one has the invitation for him.
Sugar Belle_Neutral__They belong together.
Sugar Belle_Neutral__This apple tree and pear tree are stronger together.
Sugar Belle_Neutral__Today was, interesting.
Sugar Belle_Neutral__Uh, sure.
Sugar Belle_Neutral__Wait a minute. i recognize you fillies.
Sugar Belle_Neutral__We need to talk.
Sugar Belle_Neutral__We're finished.
Sugar Belle_Neutral__Well you had such differing opinions, and cutie marks.
Sugar Belle_Neutral__Which is why you won't be delivering to my village anymore.
Sugar Belle_Neutral__Who does that two days a week.
Sugar Belle_Neutral__Why without my favorite delivery pony, I couldn't imagine being happy ever again.
Sugar Belle_Neutral__Wouldn't you say?
Sugar Belle_Neutral__You okay?
Sugar Belle_Neutral__You three played such a big part in Big Mac and I getting together.
Sugar Belle_Neutral__You're right, ok.
Sugar Belle_Neutral__thanks for the tour of ponyville, missus cake.
Sugar Belle_Neutral__they had to deal with things a lot tougher than some burnt desserts and an apple monster.
Sugar Belle_Neutral__to come here.
Sugar Belle_Neutral__well since Big Mac's plan to send me a Hearts and Hooves Day pie with a message inside didn't go so well.
Sugar Belle_Sad Anxious_Noisy_I wish everypony would just, leave me alone!
Sugar Belle_Sad Anxious__And why are you leaning like that?
Sugar Belle_Sad Anxious__Big mac, please talk to me.
Sugar Belle_Sad Anxious__I, don't understand.
Sugar Belle_Sad Anxious__Why are you breaking up with me?
Sugar Belle_Sad_Noisy_Of, all the rotten luck.
Sugar Belle_Sad_Noisy_Then why?
Sugar Belle_Sad_Noisy_Why did you take ours and not give up your own?
Sugar Belle_Sad__At least, i know i'm not any better than anypony else in the village.
Sugar Belle_Sad__Make something besides those disgusting muffins.
Sugar Belle_Surprised Anxious__Big Mac?
Sugar Belle_Surprised Anxious__What?
Sugar Belle_Surprised Confused__Big Mac?
Sugar Belle_Surprised__You made me a new display case?
Sunburst_Amused_Noisy_That's crazy!
Sunburst_Amused_Very Noisy_oh, i'm no wizard.
Sunburst_Amused__Heh heh, pretty sure it doesn't work that way.
Sunburst_Angry_Noisy_By always coming up with plans! I don't need a plan!
Sunburst_Angry__I mean, maybe i do, but it'll be mine, not yours.
Sunburst_Annoyed Sad__i know it's hard for you to understand, but not all of us end up achieving greatness.
Sunburst_Annoyed_Noisy_That's not how this.
Sunburst_Annoyed_Noisy_really? you're the protégé of the princess of friendship.
Sunburst_Annoyed__Guys!
Sunburst_Annoyed__It needs to be a real friendship problem.
Sunburst_Annoyed__Mom! it does not work like that!
Sunburst_Annoyed__Too bad there's nowhere to get actual fruit.
Sunburst_Annoyed__Urgh!
Sunburst_Annoyed__You can't just make one up!
Sunburst_Annoyed__i don't think she picks just anypony for that.
Sunburst_Annoyed__mom, there isn't a time limit.
Sunburst_Annoyed__whatever. i'm sorry i'm not the big, important wizard you were expecting.
Sunburst_Anxious Confused__What?
Sunburst_Anxious Confused__snow? that's not right. the crystal heart.
Sunburst_Anxious Whispering_Noisy_They are! this must be some kind of migration.
Sunburst_Anxious_Noisy_All the shops are different.
Sunburst_Anxious_Noisy_And if we can't connect over anything Then maybe we're not even friends!
Sunburst_Anxious_Noisy_And maybe starswirl's final words before he vanished.
Sunburst_Anxious_Noisy_But now i'm wondering if we've spent so much time apart, That we don't connect over anything anymore.
Sunburst_Anxious_Noisy_But we still have no idea where to find the villain.
Sunburst_Anxious_Noisy_Could i be experiencing the Cerebration transmogrification effect described in chapter seventeen?
Sunburst_Anxious_Noisy_I definitely would have remembered reading about this.
Sunburst_Anxious_Noisy_I mean it, looks really.
Sunburst_Anxious_Noisy_I-i don't remember reading anything that said The hollow shades was like this.
Sunburst_Anxious_Noisy_Let's hope silverstream found a good place to hide.
Sunburst_Anxious_Noisy_No table of contents.
Sunburst_Anxious_Noisy_Oh. hi, starlight.
Sunburst_Anxious_Noisy_Right after i think of them.
Sunburst_Anxious_Noisy_Right.
Sunburst_Anxious_Noisy_Solving a thousands year old mystery could take forever!
Sunburst_Anxious_Noisy_Starlight! i'm so sorry, we have to get out of here!
Sunburst_Anxious_Noisy_Starswirl's final words before he vanished!
Sunburst_Anxious_Noisy_That's the last entry.
Sunburst_Anxious_Noisy_That's the last entry.
Sunburst_Anxious_Noisy_There could be hundreds more cockatrices on the way.
Sunburst_Anxious_Noisy_Think of the research, the re-reading, the re-re-reading.
Sunburst_Anxious_Noisy_Uh huh.
Sunburst_Anxious_Noisy_Uh, right. ok.
Sunburst_Anxious_Noisy_We did everything together.
Sunburst_Anxious_Noisy_We used to be.
Sunburst_Anxious_Noisy_Where would we even start?
Sunburst_Anxious_Noisy_Working on it.
Sunburst_Anxious_Noisy_be careful!
Sunburst_Anxious_Very Noisy_It's possible they've come for the baby.
Sunburst_Anxious_Very Noisy_This changeling replaced your friend to get close to the baby. What other explanation could there be?
Sunburst_Anxious_Very Noisy_but i can't. i wish i could.
Sunburst_Anxious_Very Noisy_i know how to stop this!
Sunburst_Anxious_Very Noisy_look, starlight, i want to help, i do.
Sunburst_Anxious_Very Noisy_right, right right right.
Sunburst_Anxious_Very Noisy_right.
Sunburst_Anxious_Very Noisy_to know so much and not be able to do any of it!
Sunburst_Anxious_Very Noisy_what? oh, right, yes haha, no rest for the wizardly.
Sunburst_Anxious_Very Noisy_you know, i'd like to help. i i really would, i i just have so much, um.
Sunburst_Anxious__And, the reptilian birds are elusive and solitary!
Sunburst_Anxious__Everything's changed!
Sunburst_Anxious__Fixing an ancient relic? i i can't even come close to doing something like that!
Sunburst_Anxious__Hiding from my mother.
Sunburst_Anxious__I know what this means!
Sunburst_Anxious__I-i mean, it is, right?
Sunburst_Anxious__I-it's not.
Sunburst_Anxious__Mom!
Sunburst_Anxious__Mom?
Sunburst_Anxious__Mudbriar's been turned to stone?
Sunburst_Anxious__My cutie mark is glowing!
Sunburst_Anxious__My goodness, i-it's, been a, long time!
Sunburst_Anxious__No no.
Sunburst_Anxious__No, not avoiding Just, taking a break.
Sunburst_Anxious__Oh, no, y-yes! uh, yes, that's me, yup, aheh, important wizard!
Sunburst_Anxious__Oh, of course! s-starlight!
Sunburst_Anxious__Princess twilight, what an honor this is.
Sunburst_Anxious__Really busy with lots of, uh, wi-wizarding, stuff.
Sunburst_Anxious__Right.
Sunburst_Anxious__She doesn't.
Sunburst_Anxious__She started making up friendship problems for me to solve.
Sunburst_Anxious__Uh.
Sunburst_Anxious__We're never going to find the friendship problem With them around.
Sunburst_Anxious__Well, the good news is, we know why we're here.
Sunburst_Anxious__What, uh, what have you been up to?
Sunburst_Anxious__What? um, no. uh, like you said, i'm a, i-important, wizard.
Sunburst_Anxious__Why am i yelling!?
Sunburst_Anxious__and yes, that's me. yep. ha ha. important wizard.
Sunburst_Anxious__er But they definitely can't hear us in here, right?
Sunburst_Anxious__i don't know if i'll have time for any wizarding.
Sunburst_Anxious__i know princess twilight is keen on the two of us rekindling our friendship but, it's been so long.
Sunburst_Anxious__i'm a crystaller now, that's a big responsibility.
Sunburst_Anxious__the gaze of the cockatrice is known To petrify any who dare to cross its path!
Sunburst_Anxious__uh, i don't see how that would help.
Sunburst_Anxious__yeah, well, reading about magic is one thing, but you don't know what it was like at magic school.
Sunburst_Anxious__you showed up thinking i was some big wizard.
Sunburst_Confused_Noisy_In the antique store?
Sunburst_Confused_Noisy_So, pinkie pie just dove in and made copies of herself?
Sunburst_Confused_Noisy_Uh, who?
Sunburst_Confused_Noisy_What worked?
Sunburst_Confused_Noisy_is this cake supposed to be so sharp?
Sunburst_Confused__Aren't you excited?
Sunburst_Confused__Comedy?
Sunburst_Confused__Essence of what?
Sunburst_Confused__I don't remember that.
Sunburst_Confused__I don't understand. did something happen To you after i left for magic school?
Sunburst_Confused__I'm called for a friendship mission?
Sunburst_Confused__So, the princess of friendship wants you And i to be friends again?
Sunburst_Confused__The sires hollow development what?
Sunburst_Confused__W-where do ponies buy fruit?
Sunburst_Confused__Was that a joke?
Sunburst_Confused__What do you mean?
Sunburst_Confused__me?
Sunburst_Confused__the baby did this!?
Sunburst_Happy_Noisy_Actually, the stuff i bought is inside the barrel.
Sunburst_Happy_Noisy_Are you kidding?
Sunburst_Happy_Noisy_But i can't wait to see what it is.
Sunburst_Happy_Noisy_Did you see this palominian letter opener?
Sunburst_Happy_Noisy_Exactly!
Sunburst_Happy_Noisy_Great! goodnight starlight.
Sunburst_Happy_Noisy_Historical knickknacks, ancient relics.
Sunburst_Happy_Noisy_I can't believe you found a copy.
Sunburst_Happy_Noisy_I mean, first antiquing and then spending time with twilight?
Sunburst_Happy_Noisy_I probably have more in common with twilight Than any pony in equestria!
Sunburst_Happy_Noisy_I've got it! try placing your horn directly on the potion.
Sunburst_Happy_Noisy_I've never seen magical runes like these before.
Sunburst_Happy_Noisy_Is this.
Sunburst_Happy_Noisy_Maybe we should ask twilight what she recommends we see!
Sunburst_Happy_Noisy_Oooh! check out all these chandeliers!
Sunburst_Happy_Noisy_Right? i mean, i know she's a princess, But i never thought she'd be so fun to just, hang out with.
Sunburst_Happy_Noisy_That's it!
Sunburst_Happy_Noisy_This is so great.
Sunburst_Happy_Noisy_Who doesn't like antiquing? Right?
Sunburst_Happy_Noisy_Who knew i'd be the one showing You the cool sights of ponyville?
Sunburst_Happy_Noisy_Wow, what a difference between the hoof molded bricks And the extruded ones, right?
Sunburst_Happy_Very Noisy_the crystalling, of course!
Sunburst_Happy__So, they load up a box or barrel and sell it, Without knowing what's inside.
Sunburst_Happy__Starlight!
Sunburst_Happy__Sure!
Sunburst_Happy__That's exactly what i'll do.
Sunburst_Happy__Together.
Sunburst_Happy__You and me! on a mission!
Sunburst_Happy__You mean we've both been called? This is great!
Sunburst_Happy__the great thing about home is It always stays just how you.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_And picture the clock you wish to make.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_And starlight and i share a lot of things too.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_Anyway, i better get some sleep.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_At the base of foal mountain.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_Bringing the book back here let us see what happened.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_But i know you wanted to play.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_But i wouldn't say the mystery's solved.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_But, i have a little more control over my horn now.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_Do you hear that?
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_For example, by the speleothems in this cave, I kinda figured there was another way out.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_Great. uh, is twilight up yet?
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_Have you?
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_How do you tell the difference?
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_How have we never talked about this?
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_I always liked close up magic, because i knew i could do it If i just practiced enough.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_I can't believe you figured out How to trigger her nesting response.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_I can't believe you managed to do it without magic.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_I dabble.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_I don't have much in common with most ponies.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_I don't think any of them are.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_I don't think he is here.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_I don't understand.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_I guess that makes sense.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_I just need to think of them.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_I know this trick.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_I mean, it is surprising how well i get along with All of her friends but, she and i still have tons in common.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_I suppose i'm just surprised at how well we get along.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_I thought it'd be fun to play a version big enough For full grown ponies.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_I'm sure starswirl and the pillars did the best they could Back then, but magic has come a long way.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_If we do it just right, it should allow us To materialize an object that was lost in the past!
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_In the original olde ponish.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_Is this gneiss, phyllite, or slate?
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_It'll take years of study before we fully understand it.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_It's a blind buy.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_It's a long way between ponyville and mount aris.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_It's an olde ponish saying.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_It, loses something in the translation.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_Maud and i found some fascinating sedimentary stratum But, when i turned to show you, you were gone.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_Of course! powerful magic like that Would leave an impression on this place.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_Of course, I've been looking forward to this visit for a long time.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_Oh.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_Ok, let's drop your stuff off at the castle first.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_Petrified dessert?
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_Ponyville might be small, but there's a lot to do.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_See you soon?
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_She could be anywhere.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_Sometimes, the crystals have magical properties.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_Starlight and i have known each other since we were foals But, that doesn't mean we have to be foals to hang out.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_Starlight, what happened?
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_Starlight?
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_Starswirl's spell was one of the most powerful feats of magic In all of history.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_Sure, only.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_The earth ponies of the mighty helm Were able to map the entire coast of equestria.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_There's a special link, but i could never Hold the chain up long enough to find it.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_They'd have to be pretty distant. The hollow shades was abandoned eons ago.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_Trust me, starlight.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_Twilight, are you serious?
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_Uh, Great.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_Um, of course!
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_Um. would you mind, turning around, or preferably, Leaving the room so i could, get changed?
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_We are going antiquing and you are gonna love it!
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_We came to help.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_We don't really have that.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_We had to take out a few spaces to get it to fit But you hardly miss them.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_We might need a more concrete plan.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_Well, i didn't want to pretend to be a foal.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_Well, it's an exciting game.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_Well, that's more than i can think of That she and i have in common.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_What do you think?
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_What's out there about saving the most legendary ponies Of all time, from a thousands year old prison?
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_What's this?
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_Whoa. this place is pure ponylore.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_Without the help of unicorn magic or pegasus flight.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_Wow. the pressure above must be pretty uniform To get the planar fabric to be this consistent.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_Yeah. what do you want to do, starlight?
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_You can save the most legendary ponies of all time?
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_You'll be the first to know.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_You, don't have to pretend to like all this stuff.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_foliation!
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_good to see you.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_i only hope it will be enough.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_oh, actually, there's several.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_reward prefers risk.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_that should curb the little one's power fluctuations.
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_uh What did you figure out?
Sunburst_Neutral_Noisy_we, may need to, make a few trips.
Sunburst_Neutral_Very Noisy_A changeling's been spotted nearby.
Sunburst_Neutral_Very Noisy_And ever since flurry heart's crystalling, The empire is filled with more love than anywhere in equestria.
Sunburst_Neutral_Very Noisy_Are you taking some kind of core sample?
Sunburst_Neutral_Very Noisy_Changelings feed off of love.
Sunburst_Neutral_Very Noisy_Wow.
Sunburst_Neutral_Very Noisy_and, a little fledgling's forbearance for the parents.
Sunburst_Neutral_Very Noisy_but i i get the feeling the princess isn't looking for a spell.
Sunburst_Neutral_Very Noisy_combining that spell, with the light and love of everypony gathered for the ceremony.
Sunburst_Neutral_Very Noisy_i'd be honored.
Sunburst_Neutral_Very Noisy_important wizard work to do around here.
Sunburst_Neutral_Very Noisy_mistmane's material amity, rockhoof's rapport, flashprance's fellow, ship.
Sunburst_Neutral_Very Noisy_oh i heard you, but but like i said, when you're an important wizard, the work just piles up.
Sunburst_Neutral_Very Noisy_restoring a relic like this is magic way beyond one spell.
Sunburst_Neutral_Very Noisy_something that strengthens it and provides it with power.
Sunburst_Neutral_Very Noisy_the crystal heart's been around for millennia.
Sunburst_Neutral_Very Noisy_the spell of relic reconstitution, that won't do it.
Sunburst_Neutral_Very Noisy_together with, somnambula's weather abjuration to clear away the snow.
Sunburst_Neutral_Very Noisy_you'd need to combine it with something else, something unique to the relic itself.
Sunburst_Neutral__And if you start to drive me crazy again, I'll tell you instead of never coming home.
Sunburst_Neutral__Antiquing.
Sunburst_Neutral__Antiquing.
Sunburst_Neutral__But i definitely don't feel lost anymore.
Sunburst_Neutral__But starlight and i realized we came here To fix a friendship problem we already had.
Sunburst_Neutral__Can you hold the books?
Sunburst_Neutral__Didn't this used to be a fruit stand?
Sunburst_Neutral__Do you think that will work?
Sunburst_Neutral__Fun right?
Sunburst_Neutral__Huh.
Sunburst_Neutral__Huh. I guess it is adorable.
Sunburst_Neutral__I don't even have to go home.
Sunburst_Neutral__I haven't been home in a while either.
Sunburst_Neutral__I think i liked it better when they were fighting.
Sunburst_Neutral__If this really is a migration, It'll take a full lunar cycle to complete.
Sunburst_Neutral__Just to see if there were issues any of you had With your friends.
Sunburst_Neutral__Like, having a friendship problem?
Sunburst_Neutral__Maud made the dice.
Sunburst_Neutral__Maybe we should have sent spike after all.
Sunburst_Neutral__Mm hmm. sure thing.
Sunburst_Neutral__Mostly because of the work they did.
Sunburst_Neutral__My mom actually does kind of the same thing.
Sunburst_Neutral__No, i came to apologize.
Sunburst_Neutral__Oh i'm not sorry for that.
Sunburst_Neutral__Oh, my cutie mark is glowing.
Sunburst_Neutral__Once i found a first edition history of equestria.
Sunburst_Neutral__Ponyville is antique central.
Sunburst_Neutral__Pretty much any time we weren't working on magic.
Sunburst_Neutral__Right.
Sunburst_Neutral__She sends me letters constantly Asking about my plans for the future.
Sunburst_Neutral__Sires hollow?
Sunburst_Neutral__Sometimes, shops get too busy to go through everything.
Sunburst_Neutral__Starlight and i already figured out what the problem is.
Sunburst_Neutral__That's not really how it works.
Sunburst_Neutral__We should get going, now that we've solved The friendship problem right, starlight?
Sunburst_Neutral__Well, if you come with me and help fix it, I'll give you a better one.
Sunburst_Neutral__What else do you guys have in common?
Sunburst_Neutral__What's this?
Sunburst_Neutral__What? oh! hi!
Sunburst_Neutral__Yeah. i kind of think it doesn't matter As long as we enjoy each other's company.
Sunburst_Neutral__Yes? what can i do for you?
Sunburst_Neutral__You are so lucky.
Sunburst_Neutral__You can't be expected to supervise your students every second of every day.
Sunburst_Neutral__You don't have to worry mom, I need to find my own way.
Sunburst_Neutral__You know i like antiquing.
Sunburst_Neutral__You know, no matter how many times i read it, Houyhnhnm's guide to magical arcana never gets boring.
Sunburst_Neutral__did you really travel through time?
Sunburst_Neutral__er Just a, little reading for the train.
Sunburst_Neutral__i don't see how anything on that list is going to help.
Sunburst_Neutral__like i'd ever lose touch with my oldest friend.
Sunburst_Sad Annoyed_Noisy_well, you were wrong, ok!? i'm not an important wizard! i'm not even a wizard at all!
Sunburst_Sad Anxious__But i need to do that on my own.
Sunburst_Sad Anxious__I'm sorry i never told you how much your plans bothered me, And i know you just want me to succeed.
Sunburst_Sad__It's almost like our relationship with our parents Is the friendship problem.
Sunburst_Sad__i'm sorry we lost touch. maybe if i had reached out, you could have helped me at magic school and i could have helped you to.
Sunburst_Sad__i'm sorry. i should have told you the truth.
Sunburst_Sad__let alone solve it.
Sunburst_Sarcastic__Make a plan?
Sunburst_Sarcastic__Oh, look at the time.
Sunburst_Sarcastic__Oh. great.
Sunburst_Sarcastic__you're a grown up pony, sunburst. you need a plan.
Sunburst_Shouting_Very Noisy_citizens, may i present the newest member of the crystal empire!

Sunburst_Surprised_Noisy_really!?
Sunburst_Surprised__The princess of friendship?
Sunburst_Tired_Noisy_Is it morning already?

Svengallop_Annoyed_Noisy_Keep your hooves and tail to yourselves!
Svengallop_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Do you want me to pull countess coloratura From your little, podunk charity show!?

Svengallop_Neutral_Noisy_Oh yes, how cute and.
Svengallop_Neutral_Noisy_Speaking of which, where is the pony pinkie pie?
Svengallop_Neutral_Noisy_Though it was muddied a bit with your Interaction with that dusty farmpony.
Svengallop_Neutral_Noisy_Ugh, i can totally get you out of Meeting with the schoolponies, countess.
Svengallop_Neutral_Noisy_Well, by some miracle your requests have been reasonably met.
Svengallop_Neutral_Noisy_Why, you've gotten everything you've ever wanted!
Svengallop_Neutral_Noisy_You do it at every charity event, And it does absolutely nothing.
Svengallop_Neutral_Noisy_before She performs her run through, shall we?

Svengallop_Smug_Very Noisy_This is for me! and what i want is premium oats!
Svengallop_Smug__Good luck.
Svengallop_Smug__I deserve everything i get!
Sweetie Belle_Amused_Very Noisy_Guess i got a little carried away.
Sweetie Belle_Amused__I don't think the play was all that good.
Sweetie Belle_Amused__You cannot run from me!
Sweetie Belle_Angry Sad_Noisy_Admit you made those dresses too good on purpose!
Sweetie Belle_Angry Shouting_Noisy_How dare you!
Sweetie Belle_Angry Shouting_Noisy_In fact, i think i'll try the rest of my life Without a sister!
Sweetie Belle_Angry Shouting_Noisy_Oh, come on!
Sweetie Belle_Angry Shouting__Deal! goodbye, un-sister!
Sweetie Belle_Angry_Noisy_Ooh, dresses, dresses, dresses, dresses!
Sweetie Belle_Angry_Noisy_Well, it looks like we finally agree on something.
Sweetie Belle_Angry_Very Noisy_All i care about is that amazing red ribbon!
Sweetie Belle_Angry_Very Noisy_At least sapphire shores won't be all like ooh, who fetched you that red ribbon?
Sweetie Belle_Angry_Very Noisy_Because i don't care about anything else you made.
Sweetie Belle_Angry_Very Noisy_For pete's sake, it's all red!
Sweetie Belle_Angry_Very Noisy_I wish there was a way i could take back all the work i did!
Sweetie Belle_Angry_Very Noisy_Now i can't even sleep! happy now, big sis?
Sweetie Belle_Angry_Very Noisy_Now what?
Sweetie Belle_Angry_Very Noisy_Stop! why do you have to ruin everything?!
Sweetie Belle_Angry_Very Noisy_get away from her, you brute!
Sweetie Belle_Angry__Don't act like you don't remember.
Sweetie Belle_Angry__Maybe i'll try the sisterhooves social without a sister!
Sweetie Belle_Angry__Neither of us needs a sister!
Sweetie Belle_Angry__Stealing the spotlight like you always do! it's my fifth birthday party all over again!
Sweetie Belle_Angry__Yes, good. not jaw dropping amazing!
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed Anxious_Very Noisy_Come on, we've gone far enough!
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed Anxious_Very Noisy_Time to go back.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed Anxious__Or how twilight could blame us for it.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed Sarcastic_Noisy_So we, can do what, you want to do?
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed Shouting_Noisy_Hey! that's our metaphorical sunset they're riding off into!
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed Shouting_Very Noisy_A lot!
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed Tired_Very Noisy_rarity, the sun's not even up yet.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed Whispering_Noisy_I just wanted to do something nice for my sister.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed Whispering_Very Noisy_Evil!
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_A lot dirty.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_Agh! i think i threw my neck out.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_And excuse me but, how do you keep from getting all pruney?
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_Both worlds.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_Dark, wet, sea monsters.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_Geez, louise. can't i do anything right?
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_How could you?!
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_I don't believe it. after everything i put up with all week long!
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_I doubt it, That thing weighs a ton.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_I just wish we could do something special together That didn't include me goofing anything up.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_I'm just too tired!
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_I'm not talking to either one of you ever again!
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_Isn't there anypony here who remembers anything about the play besides the dresses!?
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_It was a long ride!
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_It's not chaos, you dodo.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_It's not just the social. she thinks i'm uncouth.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_Just forget it!
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_No grass to run in, and no hooves to run on it with.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_Not even close.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_Not even miss cheerilee can make the history Of radishes exciting.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_Ok. enough!
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_Rarity! i thought you said i was gonna help.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_Really?! if you still think i like doing this stuff.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_Right! And any sister who cares about her sister goes.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_So she could teach you What a good sister is supposed to be!
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_Then maybe you don't know me, at all.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_We can take care of this mission just fine on our own.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_Well, tell her that i'm not the one who dashed all of terramar's hopes and made him give up on the world.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_When i told you when you could come eyeball the princess At one of her favorite hangouts, I said only two or three of you, tops.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_Won't you at least let me help you clean up?
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_Worst idea ever.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_You forgot the cons.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_You mean you don't know!?
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_You really don't need to come with us twilight.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Noisy_You want me to go home with you.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Apple bloom, your newspaper idea was nothing but a big bust.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Are you snooping through my saddlebag?
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Can you believe featherweight got his cutie mark?
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Can you please keep it down with all the laughter?
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Can't seem to.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Featherweight! before us!
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Very Noisy_First they built the carts, now they're gonna drive them?
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Very Noisy_How can you say that!?
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Very Noisy_I do not like them one bit.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Very Noisy_I'm trying to, hey!
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Is not!
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Not helping!
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Now you've ruined it for everypony!
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Oh, why does life have to be so ironic?
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Very Noisy_So what? Now you're back to hating messes?
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Teach her to fool with the cutie mark crusaders.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Very Noisy_This isn't a trip to see sapphire shores!
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Urgh! you ruined the surprise. I was gonna serve you breakfast in bed!
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Well you wrote this.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Very Noisy_When is rarity gonna finish her work?
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Without seeing the palace!
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Very Noisy_You mean, my hooves.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed_Very Noisy_i'm so bored!
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed__And we certainly don't have time to hang out in an old clubhouse.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed__Are you sure i can't help?
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed__Dumb fabric.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed__Girls!
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed__Hmph. rarity never wants to do chores together.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed__How's the school paper gonna get us our cutie marks?
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed__Miss harshwhinny never said anything about that!
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed__No!
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed__No, they were perfect, and that was the whole problem!
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed__No.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed__Not sisters like rarity.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed__Or are you trying to prove you're a better actress than me too!?
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed__Our special talent is not arguing.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed__Rarity never high hooves me.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed__That's not a word!
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed__That's the last word rarity would use.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed__That's what i kept on saying.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed__The derby was supposed to be for us, not the three of you!
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed__There! i knew it! you did this on purpose!
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed__We're not wild swamp ponies. We're just grown ups.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed__Well, then, maybe.
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed__What does every pony always think i'm gonna sing?
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed__You are so careless!
Sweetie Belle_Annoyed__You just haikued right then!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious Confused_Noisy_What just happened?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious Sad_Noisy_We've ruined all of our friendships, and we still don't have our cutie marks!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious Sad_Very Noisy_Gabby really believed in us, and now we're going to let her down.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious Shouting_Noisy_Listen to my sister!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious Shouting_Noisy_No wait!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious Shouting_Noisy_She left for canterlot!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious Shouting_Noisy_waaa! make it stop! make it stop!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious Shouting_Very Noisy_Don't!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious Shouting_Very Noisy_We need to find somewhere to hide!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious Whispering_Noisy_Get ready!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious Whispering_Noisy_Left, left!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious Whispering_Noisy_Please say no, please say no, please say no.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious Whispering_Noisy_They're coming!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious Whispering__If we want to impress her, we need to really wow her.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious Whispering__Me too, but all she cares about now is flying.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious Whispering__Rarity says there's never been a school like it.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious Whispering__She's from manehattan.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious Whispering__Sssh! it's rude to ask a question like that!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious Whispering__Twilight?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_Agh! now what?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_And ever!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_And tonight's the closing ceremony!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_And we'll need beds for when they're tired!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_Apple bloom! shhh. we haven't heard it yet.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_Applejack, help!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_Are you ok?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_Are you okay, applejack?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_At least she likes her present?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_But are you sure you feel content?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_But i can't stand having a secret admirer who's too scared to tell me who he is!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_But if we can't find anypony with a problem.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_But that's not true, scootaloo!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_But then i realized i didn't want your future to be ruined forever and ever.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_But we just want our cutie marks so badly!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_But we worked so hard on this chart.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_But, it's a symbol, you know?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_Do either of you have any idea where we are?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_Flowers. don't forget the flowers.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_Forever!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_Gabby, we're your friends!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_He said it again!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_Hoo boy.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_How? our camp was so pretty and this cave is sooo.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_I can't believe you're quitting on us!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_I did.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_I do understand, and we've all been feeling guilty.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_I don't know.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_I don't think scootaloo can hold her off much longer!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_I hope everything goes allright for her tomorrow.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_I kept meaning to ask her, i really did, but.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_I mean, isn't it a hit?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_I mean, yeah, i mean.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_I think i need your expertise.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_I think we may have given Them, too big of a nudge.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_I thought everypony was having fun.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_I thought we weren't going to wander off again?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_I'm too late!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_I've never even heard of a pony zip lining before.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_Is this a good idea?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_It's, just that i know how important it is for you To finish this wardrobe in time for sapphire shores and her backup dancers.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_Kettle corn, you covered your cutie mark?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_Miss cheerilee, are you all right?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_No! i-i'm just, um, really, hungry.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_Oh no, here it comes.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_Oh yeah.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_Oh, no!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_Ok, but stay out of sight.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_Ok, so maybe we need a new plan.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_Okay, Apparently it was all because The prince and princess were so Lost in each other's eyes.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_Please, applejack! she didn't mean.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_Please?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_Please?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_Rarity?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_Scootaloo, do you have anything?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_Scootaloo? you okay?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_She's been very busy lately!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_She's right, it's like you don't even need us anymore.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_She's staying home!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_So i pulled out the center stitch to the head piece so it would fall apart.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_So uh, we'll just leave you two alone.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_The thing is.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_This way. i know a short cut.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_Uh oh.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_Uh, girls?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_Wait!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_We didn't have a chance to ask twilight, so,.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_We don't get it.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_We should totally say yes, This is a golden opportunity!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_We tried to talk him into it.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_We were gonna set up a stand and Try to sell it but, we needed somepony to taste test it first.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_We've been together our whole lives!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_Well, actually we kinda told her.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_What am i gonna do?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_What happened! is everything all right?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Noisy_What's wrong?

Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Very Noisy_And i've got the bites to prove it.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Very Noisy_And if all of equestria's magic is getting sucked up in there.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Very Noisy_And now we've turned into bullies too.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Very Noisy_But i'm not a fan!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Very Noisy_But it's booby trapped.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Very Noisy_But the gossip we've been printing is hurting everypony's feelings!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Very Noisy_But you have to let us in!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Very Noisy_But, isn't he a dangerous criminal?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Come back! come back!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Crusaders, this is terrible!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Very Noisy_How does she sleep?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I don't suppose we could, Borrow that book for a little While, do you?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I don't want to see anymore!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I'm sapphire shores' designer's sister!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Very Noisy_It's a trip to save my sister from a horrible future!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Like, maybe we could be hurting other ponies' feelings?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Very Noisy_No, i didn't mean smash.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Very Noisy_No.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Rarity doesn't deserve that at all!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Rarity, you have to help me! i think something's wrong with my horn!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Very Noisy_This is bad.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Wait! i'm coming too!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Wait, stop!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Well, yes, but, i know you have more in your work room.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Were you guys feeling guilty about all the gossip too?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Where is she?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Very Noisy_You can't do that, that's trouble shoes!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Very Noisy_You have to believe us!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Very Noisy_You sure about this, scootaloo?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Very Noisy_but starlight's trapped here, And there's no way to get word to celestia or anypony else.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious_Very Noisy_wait!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__And everypony made it clear we're too young to go on our own.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__And i really wanted to keep it that way!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__And the ponyville flag? you sure?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__And we thought we could take the train here since we were old enough but, we ended up in the wrong place just like you said we would!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__And you may have gone just a teeny, tiniest bit nutty.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__And, what if we can't follow the directions?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__Apple bloom?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__Are you sure you two got this?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__Back on stage?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__But he never wanted to ruin any rodeos!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__But is there time?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__But that doesn't make any sense!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__But there's one problem.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__But this could be our last chance to earn our cutie marks.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__But we taught her all the right things!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__But we're supposed to be doing this together!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__But, things didn't turn out so well.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__Can you imagine getting stuck With a cutie mark you didn't like?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__Can't you finish it tomorrow?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__Can't you just give us a chance?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__Do you think we got on the wrong train?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__Don't worry, we know exactly where she is.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__I bet every pony in class is planning to compete.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__I can't believe you tried all this stuff And didn't find one thing you liked.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__I can't keep going!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__I directed it, i'm in it, i made the costumes.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__I don't know, all these events look a little, well, dangerous.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__I don't know, it's like rarity doesn't even know me anymore.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__I don't think rarity would let me travel To the far reaches of equestria Looking for cutie mark problems.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__I have to leave for dress rehearsal soon, rarity!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__I hope nothing bad is going on.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__I just hope no one sees us.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__I think we're the grown ponies that need to be helping today!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__I was upset at you for stealing spotlight from me at the play.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__I worked so hard on this play, I wrote it especially for the three of us!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__I'll just go and stand over there.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__If we get stuck listening to Granny, we'll never find Big Mac.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__If you're gonna go we've gotta get you out of here now!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__Is it finished yet?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__Is that even possible?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__It's just that this is really my time to shine doing something completely myself.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__Just look!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__Maybe we added too much rainbow.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__Mine either!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__No! we were just worried about you when you lost the election, And then you lost your friend, and then your mom yelled at you.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__Oh no! the box is, gone.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__Oh, um. i guess another scoop would be fine!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__Or maybe.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__Scootaloo?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__Shouldn't they go first?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__So i came back to change it before it was too late.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__That was, uh. one tasty bite.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__Those were just bad accidents!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__Twilight, we can explain.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__Uh, hello?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__Uh, this doesn't look like Appleloosa.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__Um, well, these are, um, good.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__Um, yeah.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__Was it that bad?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__We already ended up in the wrong place, which is exactly what we were warned about.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__We have to tell applejack.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__We may have given them a love poison.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__We may have given you the teeny, tiniest bit of love potion.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__We might not have given Big mac and miss cheerilee a love potion.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__We need to talk to applejack.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__We really did think of everything.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__We're doomed.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__We've got to get in there, now!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__Well, there's something here About a dragon, a kingdom Falling, chaos reigning.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__What happened to all of our friends?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__What have we done!?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__Who knows?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__Whoa!

Sweetie Belle_Anxious__Why not?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__Yeah, kind of.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__Yeah.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__You mean we spent all this time planning a trip, and none of us asked anypony to take us?!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__You sure you want me to help? i-i just mess everything up.
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__are you sure about this, scootaloo?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__because he's afraid He'll get stuck doing something he doesn't like forever, y'know?
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__except finding somepony to take us, and the fair is only today!
Sweetie Belle_Anxious__is it weird that i feel bad for her?

Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Big Mac!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Big grand gestures always work in the fairy tales.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Big mac, you've gotta write a song for sugar belle!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_But being a blank flank is nothing to be ashamed of.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_But it sure isn't the easiest.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_But pink feathers would look so good with your eyes!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_But we have more crusading to do.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_But you're not eating anything.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_But, maybe we could just try to do different things together?

Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_But, we haven't found the chicken yet.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_C'mon, you're gonna be her hero.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Con, too far from equestria.

Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Hm, this gives me an idea.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Hmm.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Hmm. we need to do something new.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Hmmm. i see what you mean.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Hmph. i'll never get my cutie mark for this.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Honestly, it's not all that different From what they were doing here.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_How about.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_How different can they be?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_I better get some rest.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_I don't know if i'd like being a hippogriff.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_I don't know. it's no big deal. this is great.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_I got it!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_I got rid of it. to make room for our memorial.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_I guess i'm just a little jealous you two Get to compete and i don't.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_I guess we've gotta ask her but, aren't griffons supposed to be kind of mean and cranky?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_I hope you come visit your sister in equestria.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_I just can't see what we did wrong.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_I know he doesn't like non ponies, But if we tell him what's going on, he'll help.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_I know just what you need To put the bloom back on your apple.

Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_I mean, she keeps ordering apples Just so she can see you again.

Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_I think she's my favorite legend too.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_I think that might be your problem right there. come on!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_I think that pretty much sums it up.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_I um, guess i just prefer black box experimental theater.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_I'd assume there was too, if somepony told me Either one of you two'd gone evil.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_I'll go with you and help.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_I'm not better off without a sister, either.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_I'm sure they meant our carts, like the team cart. right?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_If it's for miss cheerilee, it Needs to be perfect.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_If we can keep miss cheerilee And big mac from looking into each other's eyes for one full Hour, the love curse will be Broken.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_If we're gonna get our cutie marks, we've got to give the ponies What they want.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_In fairy tales, the knight in shining armor Always gets the girl.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Is that really a griffon?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_It was nothing, really. We just felt it was the right thing to do.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_It's actually kind of sweet of him to help us out like this.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_It's just a simple harmony.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_It's ok to say no, i won't be offended.

Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Then.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_There is no camp to go back to.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_This has been great but, we have to go. It's twilight time.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_This needs something.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_This one looks nice. Better try it on, though.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Though i'm pretty sure it doesn't happen to griffons.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Thought you might want to go with us.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Three puppy paw prints.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Trying to find out what you're meant to do can be frustrating.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Twilight said to do something we like to do.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Uh, temporary headmare, right guys?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Um, apple bloom?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Um, yeah, what they said!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_We all are.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_We can't move family appreciation day.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_We could turn those trees into a nice little shelter.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_We couldn't fit all of our names, So we decided to create one for all three of us.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_We don't need to go out and do things anymore To get our cutie marks.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_We thought we'd get everycreature together for a picnic on the beach.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_We'll just have to convince him to come back and try harder.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_We're not leaving this clubhouse until we think of something!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_We've gotta catch the early train to the crystal empire.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_We, could, always tell applejack.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Well, i guess it's a good thing rarity isn't here.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Well, i think she should be arriving, right about.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Well, i've only come up with one part, but, okay!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Well, that certainly is, round.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Were there essay questions?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_What did you two want to talk about?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_What's that wonderful sound?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_What's that?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_What's the problem?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_What's tricky about inviting twilight out for a meal Thanking her for all the nice things she's done for us?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_When i finally came out of my room, i found the party going out without me.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_When i saw the big mess in your room, I thought i'd clean it up for you.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_When i was younger i read all the fairy tales.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_When you give from your heart, you don't expect anything back.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Whew, sorting all those took longer than i thought.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Which means you need an escape plan.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Why don't we just ask him?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Why is this party, cooler exactly?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_With our cutie marks we'll rock equestria.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Wow. that's almost, off the table!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Yeah, he totally blushed when you brought up How often he's been going to starlight's old village.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Yeah, sure we can.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Yep, and look.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Yep.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Yes. we know why.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_You came to learn, But instead you're getting dinner and a show!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_You have the cmc guarantee.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_You just rescued me from an maniacal laughing rarity cloud.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_You remember how long it took us to get our cutie marks?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_You said not to invite them to twilight time and i didn't, So what's the problem?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_You'll find something.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_You're pretty much guaranteed a happy ending.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_Yup, this time you only packed three suitcases.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_and not just ponies, they help everycreature.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_applebloom doesn't have her apple seedling, so she'll just grab an apple from the kitchen.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_chum of chums.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_evil!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_for some time now, you've been reading this column to get the latest dirt and the hottest buzz.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_guess we'll never know for sure unless we give it a try.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_into the forest.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_it must have used the last of its magic to make sure we'd come here and keep its memory alive!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_it's what we do.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_maybe we'd better see zecora about fixing this first.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_not much sunlight down here, is there?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_now.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_nuh uh!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_or, maybe she should be your sister.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_ten minutes down, fifty minutes to go.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_the problem boils down to this.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_there's nothing more romantic than waking Your special pony from a sleeping spell With a magical kiss!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_we are chained to this post!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_we started acting special because we were friends with someone special.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_we're the only three ponies in equestria with the same cutie mark.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_well How 'bout this one?!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Noisy_what's it do?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_A lot dirty!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_A place where we've faced all kinds of cutie mark problems.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Actually, i was sort of thinking of something more, Traditional?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Also, we'd kinda like to stop cozy before she drains all the magic from equestria.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_And I'm Sweetie Belle.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_And i kept posing at the top of the stairs waiting to be noticed, but.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_And so have we. scootaloo, you're pretty amazing.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_And then went to the stairs to enter like the belle of the ball.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_And, ah one and ah two and ah one, two, three.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_And, she's off again.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_And.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_As in actually a bad seed.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Aw, she looks so sad!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Blah blah blah blah blah. oh yes here.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Break a leg!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_But i really do love the old timey style, like this.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_But, i guess you and applejack will probably win the award For most traditional, huh?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_But, i think it adds just the right touch, don't you?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Bye, fluttershy!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Did you say, a love potion?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Don't worry sis! I promise we'll bring them back!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Don't worry. you'll be just fine.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Even better.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Even if all i got was gutter balls.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Even though things looked bleak, you still found a way to help gabby in the end.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Fast, not slow.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Forget trying to squeeze stories out of this school.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Good.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Gosh!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Green, purple, yellow, And, one more purple.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Homegirl, amiga.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_How about a nice yellow fringe on top?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_I decided to make a grand entrance.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_I have some serious field twirling to do.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_I just think these old carts look so cool.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_I lined them with this special gold silk.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_I made myself all beautiful. just like my big sister.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_I prefer show tunes.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_I remember this. this is my fifth birthday party.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_I think scootaloo should get to play with her first.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_I think we're good.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_I wish i were dressed for it, but still.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'll keep miss cheerilee Occupied. You two do the same with big mac.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm sure gonna miss that bad seed.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm sure it's nothing, Compared to the gifts you've Gotten from your.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Is there anything we can do to help?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_It's not that burnt.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Just a few necessities.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Klutzy?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Look at the stitching. real close.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Mmmm. not bad.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_No, see, first we called her bad seed.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Now scootaloo, you do know there will always be challenges.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Now, that's just a little something that we threw together.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, hi angel, is fluttershy home?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Ok, so i sketched out some of my ideas.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Ok. i know exactly how to handle this.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Or lack of a cutie mark!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Relax. i know exactly how to handle this.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Scoot, we've got a job to do.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Sequins!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_She's still going! anypony know if griffons ever get tired?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Someday, somepony might even come to us with a problem That even we can't handle.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Stir with a pegasus feather.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Thanks everypony, we couldn't have done it without you.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_That didn't turn out quite how i had hoped.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_That's when i learned never try to shine with my big sister around.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_The key is for you two to distract rarity long enough for me to put the stitch back in without her noticing.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_This makes no sense.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Totally crazy!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Trust me on this one.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Trust me.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Try to be gracious.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Unfortunately, since we don't have scootaloo's unicycle parts, She'll take apart and put back together One of the scooters from outside.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_We are unicorns!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_We better go see what's wrong.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_We booby trapped the float.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_We could form our own secret society.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_We gave up too quickly, girls.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_We need to expand!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_We'll find a way out of this, girls.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_We'll need to tell featherweight to start working overtime.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_We're just borrowing them for the talent show.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_We're not gonna find the chicken or our cutie marks By arguing.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_We're sorry, diamond tiara, but we've made our decision.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, it doesn't have to be yellow.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, we're sort of looking for rainbow dash So we can hear how she got her cutie mark.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_What does it mean?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_What she wants, it's not possible, right?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_What's so funny?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Who wants a picture of a hammer on their flank anyway?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Won't you two excuse us for a moment.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Wow! all these ponies really want to meet twilight That badly.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Wow! it's as if they're just one pony.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_Wow, this is nice, but there's no one else here.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_You're making, grape juice?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_You've got to see this with the cinnamon ribbon.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_and posthaste with glad tidings, miladies.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_and we won't engage in hurtful gossip any more.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_because she's our friend.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_boy did we get our priorities mixed up.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_forsooth and anon, i cometh forthwith.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_from now on, we promise to respect everypony else's privacy.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_i guess twilight must not be so super upset anymore, 'cause she's letting us do a diary entry like our sisters do.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_like say.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_meet you back at the Clubhouse in an hour when this whole mess is over.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_my first story's gonna be an exclusive interview.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_now that i'm getting so good at the other kind.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_we almost forgot the real reason she's special.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_we want to apologize for the pain and embarrassment we've caused.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_we're just glad twilight time is back to normal.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_well, almost back to normal.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral_Very Noisy_yona?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__A librarian with a mysterious past.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Actually i do.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__All i heard was.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__And find new favorite things to do together.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__And i'm here to catch you!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__And she's a designer.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__And the three of us thought we'd actually helped you?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__And what's not to like about apples?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__And, i'd like to be like my big sister.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__And?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Animal shows, carnival rides.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Applejack is back from manehattan already?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Applejack's going with her little sister.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__As grownup ponies.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__At least the barn's looking great for big mac's date.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Because being big is all it takes!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Because you said you weren't good at anything Except getting in trouble for making sculptures Out of your lunch, right?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Big mac, are you ready to take it up a notch?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__But don't worry, You've got three not so secret admirers right behind you!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__But since we are the cutie mark crusaders.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__But there are three of us.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__But you could go with us And we could catch those creatures.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__But, at least i get to be here and cheer you on.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__But, how about after we fight the fight.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__But, let me know if you need me or run into any trouble.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__But, remembering all the fun we had.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__But.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Can i help?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Come on in, zipporwhill.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Come on! Let's go find your brother!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Cozy glow!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Did you say something?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Doesn't look like any of us ended up with what we wanted.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Doesn't look like it's going so well.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Don't listen to them, scootaloo.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Don't worry about it, rumble. Hardly anypony finds their calling on the first try.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Don't worry girls, i think i cracked this one.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Especially when romance is involved.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Especially where our playground equipment should be?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Even though it could change everything for you.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Everypony does.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Everypony wants to know what they're meant to do.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Funny. i thought i was the only one who got worried about stuff like that.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Gabby's special purpose can't be everything, right?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Grown up legs are strong.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Hammer.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Hammer.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Have they called your brother's bluff yet?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__He's bound to show up soon.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__He's not just bigger, he's older too.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Hey scoot, how's the song going?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Hey, zipporwhill. what are you doing here?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Hmm.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Hold on, Us grown ups need to confer.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__How many spies do you know?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__How'd you know?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__How's the spin coming along?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Huh.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Huh. i remember it being much bigger.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Huh. so, now that we don't have to do stuff To get our cutie marks.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__I bet if felt good to get it out though.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__I bet yours will be too.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__I can't believe rumble isn't interested in getting His cutie mark either but, we can't force him.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__I could.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__I don't know. maybe?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__I don't suppose this dancing pony had a cutie mark, did he?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__I don't think they suspect anything.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__I guess rarity wasn't trying to steal the spotlight.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__I guess that means Twilight's busy too?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__I guess we did make things a little better.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__I guess you could teach other ponies to lift things.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__I have responsibilities and.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__I just wish we were as old as our sisters.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__I know this one.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__I know we didn't make the best impression but.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__I never got in trouble for drawing.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__I still have nightmares.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__I think i have two special ponies.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__I thought apple bloom was gonna be here too?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__I thought that you said you understood.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__I understand. but doing things like you used to Won't turn him back into a puppy.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__I was thinking something more like a salad.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__I'll be shimmering spectacles.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__I'm glad she's happy but, i sure wouldn't want to be Up to my flank in mane hair all day.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__I'm just gonna do a quick check with the cmc's.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__I'm just sorry we couldn't come through for you.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__I'm kinda right in the middle of something important.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__I'm not sure we can, I think we're lost.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__If sharing him is too hard, that might be the best thing.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__If we hadn't messed up so bad.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__If we really are supposed to be journalists, Isn't it worth a little grief?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__If we won and we got our cutie marks.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Is something supposed to happen?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__It all depends on how you look at it.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__It doesn't really count when you trick a pony Into drinking a love potion, does it?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__It must've been hours ago.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__It was a really nice compliment and all but.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__It's funny, i've been sitting here feeling sorry for myself for not having a special pony on hearts and hooves day.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__It's lucky we're all scared of the same things.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__It's sweet he wants to help you out like this.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Just as soon as you figure out what it is.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Just like the one they'll fly through in their upcoming show.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Let me see.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Let's not get carried away.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Like when there's something one of us wants to do That the others don't.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Maybe it's just a friendship problem.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Maybe my sister knows where she is.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Maybe we should do something less dangerous.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Maybe we should just go by ourselves?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Maybe we should wait for the train.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Maybe we should wait here for him.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Maybe whatever we want?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Mm hmm.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Mm-hmm, yeah.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Mount aris is the best of all possible worlds.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__No matter what it takes, We promise you'll have our full attention.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__No, no, no. you see, in the theater, It's considered bad luck to say good luck.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Not really since we kind of overheard you yesterday.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Now remember, twilight takes this time out with us So we can learn stuff.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Of course fluttershy, right away.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Of course we did.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Of course!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Of course.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Oh well.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Oh, i was wondering why all the colors looked like mud.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Oh, i'll help you!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Oh, it just came to me. in a dream.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Oh.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Oh. i was just working on our new cutie mark crusaders theme song.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Oh. is that what that's for?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Ok zipporwhill, what do you see?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__One, two, three, four.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Or a famous writer.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Or am i dreaming?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Or an amazing artist.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Or how hard it is.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Or paddle a kayak or shoot an arrow Or use a pencil.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Over the top.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Plus it's hard to speak up to older ponies.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Right now, we have to stop this and you're the only one who can do it.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Right! With super cool scenery.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Say, is there some kind of spell you can whip up To make her mark appear?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Seems like she could use a friend or two to help her figure it out.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__She could be a great scientist.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__She could even be mayor of ponyville someday.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Snap out of it. we're here to help you.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__So let's move harvest day instead.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__So nothing fishy's going on.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__So you say break a leg instead.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__So, scootaloo's keeping petunia busy like you asked.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__So, what's your cutie mark problem?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__So?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Something unexpected.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Somewhere outside.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Sounds serious.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Speaking of food, did you pack snacks for the train?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Still a little hungry though.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Sugar belle is so lucky to have a non secret admirer like big mac.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Take our word for it, We are grown ups.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__That was easy!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__That's a great, safe idea.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__That's an awful long way for a pony to go, isn't it?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__That's awful nice of you to say cousin orchard blossom! I've been told before i'm pretty observant.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__That's not what i see. i see a full grown dog.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__That's silly, Having a cutie mark doesn't mean you can't do other things.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__That's, right! when we work together, we're unstoppable!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__The flower turned us into grown ups so.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__The key is to remain calm.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__The point is we all felt bad for ruining Big Mac and Sugar Belle's proposals.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Then nopony could tell us what to do, and we'd be able to take care of ourselves.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__This is our shot to make up for all the trouble we caused when Big Mac first asked Sugar Belle out!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__This must have happen earlier tonight.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__To be honest, the costumes were the best part.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Together. to test it.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Tomorrow night.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Totally.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Treat him like the dog he is.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Trust us.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Uh, apple bloom? i think they get it.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Uh, how early?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Uh, not exactly.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Uh, we don't have time to explain.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Um, i think maybe that could have been clearer.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Um, miss cheerilee, that sounds a bit over our heads.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Um, okay.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Um, that doesn't look like a table.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Um.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Um.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Unicorns.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Very ready.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Wait, so we're not in trouble?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Wait.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__We all agree these two are Perfect for one another.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__We just can't figure out what one thing you're supposed to do.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__We just need to talk to him again.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__We know you'll get your cutie mark.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__We thought you two would be perfect together.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__We're gonna need a plan.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__We're just gonna have to keep trying!
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__We're pretty sure she likes you.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__We've got a whole lobby full of friends waiting to shower us with adoration and praise.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Weird, but sweet.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Well, all right then.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Well, i do have one idea.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Well, i was younger on the way here.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Well, it started when he couldn't toss a horseshoe.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Well, it's obvious, isn't it?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Well, maybe we were trying too hard.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Well, we used to only do stuff to get our cutie marks Or fulfil our destiny, but now we don't have to.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Well, you can't run off, but maybe somepony else can.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Well, your dad's certainly, outgoing isn't he?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__What do you girls think?

Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Who knew there were so few ponies Worried about their cutie marks?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__With each of us going out and trying things on our own.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Ya know, it's an awfully big puppy.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Yeah! it always works for rarity.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Yeah, and i think that's way more important Than worrying about our cutie marks, don't you?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Yeah, apple bloom, what's this all about?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Yeah. what's going on?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__Yes, fluttershy.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__You don't still play with the same toys From when you were a foal, do you?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__You know what would be the best?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__You may not be able to get a cutie mark.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__You mean this parsley?
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__a bright rainbow's glow.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__and let Biscuit take him to the fair.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__and we felt bad that he wasn't good at anything But now he doesn't want a cutie mark at all.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__but this will be my final piece.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__come on guys.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__don't worry applebloom, Most of your family has apple related cutie marks.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__don't worry scootaloo.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__he did.

Sweetie Belle_Neutral__we sure would like to visit you and Bloofy some day.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__we think you should share Bloofy.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__well You don't have to be good at something to have fun.
Sweetie Belle_Neutral__why? I mean, you can't come in then either.
Sweetie Belle_Sad Annoyed_Noisy_Well, cutie mark day camp is a bust.
Sweetie Belle_Sad Anxious_Noisy_All our hard work is ruined.
Sweetie Belle_Sad Anxious_Noisy_or go camping with us!? or just, hang out with us!?
Sweetie Belle_Sad Anxious_Noisy_or, or put on plays with us!?
Sweetie Belle_Sad Anxious__It seems like everypony's got somepony special but us!
Sweetie Belle_Sad Anxious__Rarity, this is hard for me to say, but.
Sweetie Belle_Sad Anxious__That's just it! i used to! that's not who i am anymore.
Sweetie Belle_Sad Anxious__and now we'll probably never see her again! it's hopeless!
Sweetie Belle_Sad Anxious__but.
Sweetie Belle_Sad Anxious__how!? there's only two of us!
Sweetie Belle_Sad Anxious__um.
Sweetie Belle_Sad Confused__i-i thought it would, make you happy.

Sweetie Belle_Sad_Noisy_Gotta go.
Sweetie Belle_Sad_Noisy_Happy hearts and hooves day, sugar belle.
Sweetie Belle_Sad_Noisy_I give up.
Sweetie Belle_Sad_Noisy_I might find my special gift and finally earn my cutie mark.
Sweetie Belle_Sad_Noisy_I'll never be a designer like my sister rarity.
Sweetie Belle_Sad_Noisy_I'm sorry i got jealous about those dresses.
Sweetie Belle_Sad_Noisy_I'm sorry, sis.
Sweetie Belle_Sad_Noisy_If you don't want to spend time with me.
Sweetie Belle_Sad_Noisy_It's all our fault.
Sweetie Belle_Sad_Noisy_Just stand over here and watch.

Sweetie Belle_Sad_Noisy_Then, why do i feel like, crying?
Sweetie Belle_Sad_Noisy_We just ended up confusing you more.
Sweetie Belle_Sad_Noisy_We made a huge mistake.
Sweetie Belle_Sad_Noisy_We wanted our time together just as a way to be with you And learn new things. Really and truly.
Sweetie Belle_Sad_Noisy_We'll never find out now.
Sweetie Belle_Sad_Noisy_Well, it's not exactly great.
Sweetie Belle_Sad_Noisy_Well, when you put it that way.
Sweetie Belle_Sad_Noisy_Well, you two have fun.
Sweetie Belle_Sad_Noisy_Yeah, we're fine.
Sweetie Belle_Sad_Noisy_i wanna go!
Sweetie Belle_Sad_Very Noisy_And we figured out you were just doing it To avoid getting picked on in ponyville.
Sweetie Belle_Sad_Very Noisy_But, by then, we were the ones being bullies.
Sweetie Belle_Sad_Very Noisy_I can't believe those mean judges would laugh at him like that.
Sweetie Belle_Sad_Very Noisy_Please forgive me.
Sweetie Belle_Sad_Very Noisy_So, here it is. it's all fixed.
Sweetie Belle_Sad_Very Noisy_We just thought.
Sweetie Belle_Sad_Very Noisy_We're really sorry, twilight.
Sweetie Belle_Sad__And we let him down.
Sweetie Belle_Sad__But. you know.
Sweetie Belle_Sad__I bet every pony in Equestria is in Appleloosa right now.
Sweetie Belle_Sad__I just thought that if i could help.
Sweetie Belle_Sad__I know now that you were only trying to help.
Sweetie Belle_Sad__I sure wish i had a sister to run the race with.
Sweetie Belle_Sad__I thought we could help anypony.
Sweetie Belle_Sad__I understand.
Sweetie Belle_Sad__It's up to every pony to choose that very special Somepony for themselves.
Sweetie Belle_Sad__Me neither.
Sweetie Belle_Sad__Meet me.
Sweetie Belle_Sad__Most of the fillies at school already have theirs.
Sweetie Belle_Sad__Oh. sorry.
Sweetie Belle_Sad__Or not.
Sweetie Belle_Sad__Plan b?
Sweetie Belle_Sad__Rarity's definitely made the biggest, boldest cart Anypony's ever seen.
Sweetie Belle_Sad__She was trying to save my party.
Sweetie Belle_Sad__Sorry, fluttershy.
Sweetie Belle_Sad__We're sorry we snuck out of the house and into the forest.
Sweetie Belle_Sad__We've run out of ideas.
Sweetie Belle_Sad__Well, technically, the clubhouse is for crusaders only.
Sweetie Belle_Sad__What are we going to do?
Sweetie Belle_Sad__Which is the prize we really wanted.
Sweetie Belle_Sad__Why not?
Sweetie Belle_Sad__You heard too, huh?
Sweetie Belle_Sad__You're too kind, apple bloom.
Sweetie Belle_Sad__right, wonderful.
Sweetie Belle_Sarcastic_Noisy_Better be careful. you might get some dust on you.
Sweetie Belle_Sarcastic_Noisy_I wonder what could have caused that.
Sweetie Belle_Sarcastic_Noisy_Instructions on how to use six wooden planks, four by eight plywood, a box of nails, four cans of paint, And four brushes.
Sweetie Belle_Sarcastic_Noisy_No, that's not red, that's cherry!

Sweetie Belle_Tired_Noisy_Good, because we better get out of here before babs finds us.
Sweetie Belle_Tired__Is this it?
Sweetie Belle_Whispering_Noisy_Good plan, apple bloom!
Sweetie Drops_Annoyed_Noisy_I'm sorry, lyra! i couldn't tell you for your own protection!
Sweetie Drops_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Or at least i did until the bugbear went missing From tartarus a few years back.
Sweetie Drops_Annoyed_Very Noisy_What is it this time?
Sweetie Drops_Annoyed__Hmph.
Sweetie Drops_Anxious_Noisy_Did you say bugbear?
Sweetie Drops_Anxious_Noisy_I had to go deep cover here in ponyville and assume the name bon bon.
Sweetie Drops_Anxious_Noisy_I never thought it'd be able to track me, but now, it has.
Sweetie Drops_Anxious_Noisy_There's just so many! How can i choose?
Sweetie Drops_Anxious_Very Noisy_It found me!
Sweetie Drops_Anxious__So, uh, you didn't happen to mention our earlier conversation About my.

Sweetie Drops_Happy_Noisy_Our friends have done it!
Sweetie Drops_Happy_Noisy_That's what best friends are for.
Sweetie Drops_Happy_Noisy_They've defeated the bugbear!
Sweetie Drops_Happy__Thank you! That's so thoughtful.
Sweetie Drops_Neutral_Noisy_It was all real. you're my very best friend.
Sweetie Drops_Neutral_Noisy_It was me who captured the bugbear.
Sweetie Drops_Neutral_Noisy_There is nothing like a best friend, is there?
Sweetie Drops_Neutral_Very Noisy_Attention, everypony!
Sweetie Drops_Neutral_Very Noisy_Every last shred of evidence Of the organization's existence was destroyed. Celestia demanded complete deniability.
Sweetie Drops_Neutral_Very Noisy_I have to admit, When matilda said we needed this place ready by today, I was a little nervous.
Sweetie Drops_Neutral_Very Noisy_I work for a super secret anti monster agency in canterlot.
Sweetie Drops_Neutral_Very Noisy_I've got to go find a crowd To blend into before i put you in danger! I'll see you at the wedding.
Sweetie Drops_Neutral_Very Noisy_It's special agent sweetie drops.
Sweetie Drops_Neutral_Very Noisy_My name isn't bon bon.
Sweetie Drops_Neutral_Very Noisy_When it escaped, we had to shut down the whole agency.
Sweetie Drops_Neutral__Hey.

Sweetie Drops_Neutral__to anypony, did you?
Sweetie Drops_Whispering_Noisy_secret identity.

Terramar_Annoyed_Noisy_Mom!
Terramar_Annoyed_Noisy_Oh, great.
Terramar_Annoyed__We do this every weekend.
Terramar_Annoyed__You're sorry, and i'm still confused.
Terramar_Anxious Annoyed_Noisy_What kind of counselor Turns away a student with a problem?
Terramar_Anxious Whispering_Noisy_At least there's no sign of silverstream.
Terramar_Anxious Whispering_Noisy_I can't imagine getting caught In the middle of that flock.
Terramar_Anxious Whispering__So what do we do?
Terramar_Anxious_Noisy_Are you sure?
Terramar_Anxious_Noisy_But we haven't found silverstream, We can't leave yet!
Terramar_Anxious_Noisy_Can we talk about all this later? Silverstream might be in the everfree forest alone.
Terramar_Anxious_Noisy_Do you think she might have stayed to finish it?
Terramar_Anxious_Noisy_He's a great guy.
Terramar_Anxious_Noisy_I know she had a big project due for twilight.
Terramar_Anxious_Noisy_I was supposed to meet her At the mount aris train station, But she never showed up.
Terramar_Anxious_Noisy_I'm terramar, silverstream's brother. I've been looking all over for you.
Terramar_Anxious_Noisy_Is starlight here? i was told she'd be here.
Terramar_Anxious_Noisy_Our parents are leading teams of hippogriffs And seaponies, searching the land and sea Between here and our home.
Terramar_Anxious_Noisy_She's not down here.
Terramar_Anxious_Noisy_Silverstream is missing!
Terramar_Anxious_Noisy_They sent me to check the school.
Terramar_Anxious_Very Noisy_Did you check her room?
Terramar_Anxious_Very Noisy_Hello? starlight?
Terramar_Anxious_Very Noisy_The clucking is coming from everywhere!
Terramar_Anxious_Very Noisy_starlight?
Terramar_Anxious__I have to get word back to our parents That silverstream could be surrounded By those terrifying birds!
Terramar_Anxious__Mom and dad are worried sick!
Terramar_Anxious__Um, according to silverstream's research.
Terramar_Anxious__Why didn't you tell anyone?
Terramar_Anxious__You don't think she went into the everfree forest To find a cockatrice by herself, do you?
Terramar_Confused_Noisy_Hey uh, are you glowing?
Terramar_Confused_Noisy_Uh, is she ok?
Terramar_Confused_Noisy_on mount aris?
Terramar_Happy_Noisy_Excuse me, miss sparkle? over here!

Terramar_Neutral_Noisy_All my relatives are nice.
Terramar_Neutral_Noisy_And me, well, i kind of go back and forth.
Terramar_Neutral_Noisy_But, i wanted to thank you For everything you did to help find her.
Terramar_Neutral_Noisy_But, you haven't been to seaquestria yet.
Terramar_Neutral_Noisy_Could that be what her project was on?
Terramar_Neutral_Noisy_How can you even compare them?
Terramar_Neutral_Noisy_I'm gonna go show them around.
Terramar_Neutral_Noisy_I'm silverstream's brother.
Terramar_Neutral_Noisy_It is kind of strange.
Terramar_Neutral_Noisy_It was split up among our kingdoms.
Terramar_Neutral_Noisy_It's a great place to live.
Terramar_Neutral_Noisy_It's a tiny piece of the magic pearl.
Terramar_Neutral_Noisy_No she isn't.
Terramar_Neutral_Noisy_No, everygriff is pretty happy up there.
Terramar_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, dad, these are silverstream's friends from equestria, they came up to.
Terramar_Neutral_Noisy_Right. like i said, mount aris is one great place to live.
Terramar_Neutral_Noisy_See, after the storm king was defeated, the sea ponies didn't have to hide anymore.
Terramar_Neutral_Noisy_So some of them changed back to hippogriffs and went home to mount aris.
Terramar_Neutral_Noisy_Sorry i'm late.
Terramar_Neutral_Noisy_That's why silverstream and my dad and some of my cousins came back here.
Terramar_Neutral_Noisy_With this.
Terramar_Neutral_Noisy_but look at this.
Terramar_Neutral_Noisy_the cockatrice prefers rocky terrain and ample shade.
Terramar_Neutral_Very Noisy_And this is.
Terramar_Neutral_Very Noisy_Come on, it's this way!
Terramar_Neutral_Very Noisy_Legend says that.
Terramar_Neutral_Very Noisy_Scootaloo, sweetie belle, apple bloom.
Terramar_Neutral_Very Noisy_That's kind of the problem.
Terramar_Neutral_Very Noisy_This is my mom, ocean flow.
Terramar_Neutral__Every other 'griff my age already knows where they belong.
Terramar_Neutral__For everything.
Terramar_Neutral__Hippogriffs really like being hippogriffs.

Terramar_Neutral__Silverstream and i should get going.
Terramar_Neutral__Terramar.
Terramar_Neutral__Thanks.
Terramar_Neutral__That way, i don't have to be on land or in the water.
Terramar_Neutral__Those are the harmonizing heights.
Terramar_Neutral__Yeah! queen novo thought it was important to return our village to its former glory.
Terramar_Sad_Noisy_But seaquestria is another great place to live.
Terramar_Sad_Noisy_I can't.
Terramar_Sad_Noisy_I'm staying in my tree.
Terramar_Sad_Noisy_So no matter where i am, i feel like i'm letting someone down.
Terramar_Sad_Noisy_That's where my mom is.
Terramar_Sad__Not really.

Thorax_Anxious Confused__That doesn't make any sense.
Thorax_Anxious_Noisy_But i can't keep pretending To be a crystal pony forever, can i?
Thorax_Anxious_Noisy_But instead he's out there alone Somewhere between us and that rampaging monster?
Thorax_Anxious_Noisy_But we're friends.
Thorax_Anxious_Noisy_But, but it sounds like it's too late for that too.
Thorax_Anxious_Noisy_Even if i wanted to, there's no way past the guards. We'll be spotted for sure.

Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_But the story about my brother was when i was two.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_But you should let your friends know how you feel.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_Chrysalis' throne is carved from an ancient dark stone That soaks up outside magic the same way changelings Soak up love.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_Fine.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_First of all, i want to say thank you for having me over.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_Forgot about the whole feeding thing.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_How else are you gonna solve your problems?
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_How'd it go with pharynx?
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_I can't blame them.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_I got there.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_I know this trick. if he says to go left, We should definitely go right.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_I want to have honeysuckle nectar for lunch.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_I'm in a bit of a leadership pickle, And i could use some advice.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_If he wasn't my brother, i don't think i'd be here.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_Is there a dining room in the castle?
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_It's a bit overwhelming. but we're adjusting.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_It's a feelings, forum.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_It's fine. We know not everypony sees us the way you do.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_It's just, why bother fighting the maulwurf then?
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_Look, i know he's an aggressive warrior type But, when i was little, every young changeling Wanted to be like that.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_Me too.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_Now c'mon, let's go home.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_Now maybe try to be more specific.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_Oh! with an intruder in the hive, They went to protect the queen.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, spike.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, you have to.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_Ok, that's a good first attempt.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_So, what's your deal?
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_Starlight. how do you feel about Honeysuckle and peanut butter sandwiches?
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_Swing dancing,
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_Talking about your feelings does.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_That's because that kind of competition can divide you.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_The other changelings are sick of it and if i can't get him To accept love and friendship and change like the rest of us.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_There you are! Done with your boring paper work i see.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_There's theater.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_There've been a lot of changes since you were here last.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_Twilight really likes chairs.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_Uh huh.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_Uh, it's more fun than it sounds.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_Unless you still want to leave the hive.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_We don't do that anymore.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_We're going to have to face the maulwurf by ourselves.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_Well, honestly, no, not really.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_Well, maybe now we can talk.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_Well, next time, ask before you run off.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_Well, operation lead maulwurf away is coming along.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_Well, that's why they're called the old days, Because they're old.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_Well, you certainly don't act like it.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_What happened to the ice cream?
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_What's this flame thingy?
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_Where?
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_Why are you hitting yourself?
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_Yep. pharynx is my elder, brood mate.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_You can come with me, to the feelings forum.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_You could have left it alone.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_You definitely wouldn't.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_You know i think my leadership problems started in childhood.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_You know you don't have to be sappy or huggy feely about it.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_You know, now that you've said it, i am a little hungry.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_You're sure you're ok handling pharynx?
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_but pharynx never let them hurt me.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_but she's not a dragon.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_hey this is how we've been doing things For hundreds of years.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_huh, I guess i can be tough when i'm defending my friends but.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_it's how she keeps the hive safe.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_it's like they don't want to, even though I'm the leader.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_oh This castle visit is getting weird.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_oh, I have to head outside.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_oooh!
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_pharynx used to be head of patrol.
Thorax_Neutral_Noisy_the others would pick on me for not wanting to fight.
Thorax_Neutral_Very Noisy_And i couldn't just, steal it and feed on its love. I wanted to share it!
Thorax_Neutral_Very Noisy_And we're the only ones who can navigate it.
Thorax_Neutral_Very Noisy_But i'd never seen true friendship like that.
Thorax_Neutral_Very Noisy_Evil? oh, not me. all i've ever wanted is a friend.
Thorax_Neutral_Very Noisy_Good thinking, starlight!
Thorax_Neutral_Very Noisy_Hi, it's a pleasure to.
Thorax_Neutral_Very Noisy_I did.
Thorax_Neutral_Very Noisy_I guess so.
Thorax_Neutral_Very Noisy_I guess they do.
Thorax_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'll definitely remember it.
Thorax_Neutral_Very Noisy_It's a changeling hive. it shifts and changes like we do.
Thorax_Neutral_Very Noisy_It's, total chaos to non changelings.
Thorax_Neutral_Very Noisy_Oh, i-i can probably explain.
Thorax_Neutral_Very Noisy_Princess twilight said.
Thorax_Neutral_Very Noisy_The ice is pretty slippery.
Thorax_Neutral_Very Noisy_Yeah, maulwurf, Why are you hitting yourself?
Thorax_Neutral_Very Noisy_You know what i mean.
Thorax_Neutral_Very Noisy_You were there when spike defended me to the ponies Of the crystal empire.
Thorax_Neutral_Very Noisy_there's no help coming from the crystal empire.
Thorax_Neutral_Very Noisy_um guys?
Thorax_Neutral__A-and you definitely gotta hear it.
Thorax_Neutral__Actually, i haven't been since i met spike.
Thorax_Neutral__And changelings are always hungry.
Thorax_Neutral__And i know there's still good in him.
Thorax_Neutral__And maybe one day i can take that knowledge back To the changeling kingdom.
Thorax_Neutral__Anyway, what did you want to talk to me about?
Thorax_Neutral__Aren't you coming?
Thorax_Neutral__Even though i said, hey let's not do that anymore, they say.
Thorax_Neutral__Everyone please, i understand pharynx Can be challenging at times.
Thorax_Neutral__Here's my problem.
Thorax_Neutral__Hey, that was really great advice.
Thorax_Neutral__I know pharynx loved me, in his own way.
Thorax_Neutral__I like to brag to all my friends about my letters From spike the brave and glorious.
Thorax_Neutral__I promise i'll talk to him.
Thorax_Neutral__I told you, Stay in your own form.
Thorax_Neutral__I was able to convince all of them to change eh, except one of them.
Thorax_Neutral__I'm here to save you!
Thorax_Neutral__I'm trying to start some new activities since the only thing We did before was hunt and patrol.
Thorax_Neutral__If i had a friend, maybe the love we shared could sustain me but.
Thorax_Neutral__It's ok, pharynx.
Thorax_Neutral__It's really helped bring the hive closer together.
Thorax_Neutral__It's the polite thing to do.
Thorax_Neutral__No, but i was raised by an evil queen. i'm thorax.
Thorax_Neutral__Oh, she did. really helpful.
Thorax_Neutral__Once i made a few friends, i guess i just sort of.
Thorax_Neutral__Or was i one?
Thorax_Neutral__So what do you think i should do?
Thorax_Neutral__That was a pretty good plan.
Thorax_Neutral__That's good advice.
Thorax_Neutral__That's why i keep sticking up for him.
Thorax_Neutral__We can never get enough love.
Thorax_Neutral__Who else is coming?
Thorax_Neutral__Why do you think you're so bad at friendship?
Thorax_Neutral__Yes.
Thorax_Neutral__You can let them go.
Thorax_Neutral__You invited me, and i'm not one to back out of an invitation.
Thorax_Neutral__You want to talk it out?
Thorax_Neutral__i don't think the crystal ponies want to be friends.
Thorax_Neutral__oh, It's a place for changelings to express their feelings So we all gain a better understanding of each other.
Thorax_Neutral__there's this renegade group of changelings Who still feed off of love.
Thorax_Sad Annoyed_Noisy_just like my own changelings.
Thorax_Sad Anxious_Noisy_Oh.
Thorax_Sad_Noisy_How can you expect ponies who look like this.
Thorax_Sad_Noisy_I set off looking for love to share but.
Thorax_Sad_Noisy_I tried asking them to please follow my directions.
Thorax_Sad_Noisy_I wouldn't want you to get hurt because of me.
Thorax_Sad_Noisy_I'm starving!
Thorax_Sad_Noisy_I, i guess it's not surprising.
Thorax_Sad_Noisy_It's about pharynx, isn't it?
Thorax_Sad_Noisy_Leave me again.
Thorax_Sad_Noisy_My brother.
Thorax_Sad_Noisy_To trust something that looks like, this?
Thorax_Sad_Noisy_We're used to it.
Thorax_Sad_Noisy_You thought i'd be too soft and someone like ember Would never respect me.
Thorax_Sad_Noisy_because i'm having trouble leading my pack, So i don't really want to go home.
Thorax_Sad_Noisy_every young changeling except me.
Thorax_Sad_Very Noisy_From the moment i first split my egg in the nursery hive.
Thorax_Sad_Very Noisy_I, was, part of the attack on canterlot During the royal wedding.
Thorax_Sad_Very Noisy_Leave me alone!
Thorax_Sad__After that i knew i couldn't live with my kind anymore.
Thorax_Sad__Everyone in the crystal empire loves you.
Thorax_Sad__I couldn't ask you to give that up for me.
Thorax_Sad__If only that were true.
Thorax_Sad__It's fine.
Thorax_Sad__It's ok. i know it's hard.
Thorax_Sad__It's ok. i know you don't want to be friends.
Thorax_Sad__No no, it's cool.
Thorax_Sad__That bad, huh?
Thorax_Sad__Uh, i understand. well thanks for trying.
Thorax_Surprised__Starlight?
Thorax_Surprised__Trixie?
Thunderlane_Anxious_Noisy_I know she'll be mad if i'm late!
Thunderlane_Anxious_Noisy_Oh, i was afraid of this.
Thunderlane_Anxious__Not a thing, but right now he isn't even giving Anything else a chance.
Thunderlane_Confused_Noisy_How in equestria did he do that?
Thunderlane_Confused_Noisy_Let me get this straight, My little brother upended your entire camp?
Thunderlane_Happy_Noisy_But i really like to cook.
Thunderlane_Happy_Noisy_Have fun!
Thunderlane_Happy_Noisy_Hey everypony! it's me!
Thunderlane_Happy_Noisy_I didn't want to at first, but now i love it.
Thunderlane_Happy_Noisy_Of course!
Thunderlane_Happy__I just wish i tried it sooner.
Thunderlane_Neutral_Noisy_Aw sorry little brother you're right.
Thunderlane_Neutral_Noisy_Great, so there's no pressure.
Thunderlane_Neutral_Noisy_He won't do anything else.
Thunderlane_Neutral_Noisy_I'm going to wonderbolt practice. You're going to cutie mark practice.
Thunderlane_Neutral_Noisy_Nope! i know i'm a wonderbolt And my cutie mark is all about moving fast.
Thunderlane_Neutral_Noisy_Now you have a good time, and try some stuff.
Thunderlane_Neutral_Noisy_Speaking of which, aren't you supposed to be at camp?
Thunderlane_Neutral_Noisy_There's more to me than just flying, And i bet there's more to you too.
Thunderlane_Neutral_Noisy_Uh whatchya got there, little brother?
Thunderlane_Neutral_Noisy_We take turns making the meals at wonderbolt hq.
Thunderlane_Neutral_Noisy_Well, you're still going back tomorrow. You can't be a blank flank forever.
Thunderlane_Neutral_Noisy_You can try everything and not be worried about looking bad.
Thunderlane_Neutral_Noisy_You might be the most elite flyer in equestria someday.
Thunderlane_Neutral_Noisy_then i bet it'll work for these little guys too!
Thunderlane_Neutral_Noisy_wish i could stay and play, but it's time to fly!
Thunderlane_Neutral__But for now, you should try other things too.
Thunderlane_Neutral__Ever since i became a wonderbolt, Rumble's either watching me, or trying to fly like me.
Thunderlane_Neutral__No, i don't.
Thunderlane_Neutral__Rumble's good at all that stuff.
Thunderlane_Neutral__That's why i thought your camp was such a good idea.
Thunderlane_Neutral__Who knows what you'll be good at?
Tight End_Neutral__Lady, you just described half the ponies in this place.
Tirek_Angry Shouting_Noisy_Don't you dare bring gram gram into this!
Tirek_Angry Shouting_Noisy_Where is your magic?!
Tirek_Angry_Noisy_Fine! i'll help you leave.
Tirek_Angry_Noisy_Just please stop.
Tirek_Angry__Stay away from the Bell you pest!
Tirek_Annoyed_Noisy_And you didn't tell me this?
Tirek_Annoyed_Noisy_At least now we can see the real you.
Tirek_Annoyed_Noisy_Fine! i'll join your meeting. just leave.
Tirek_Annoyed_Noisy_I am surprised that someone with your intellect Does not see this, friendship, is but a new form of imprisonment.
Tirek_Annoyed_Noisy_I want an answer, and i want it now!
Tirek_Annoyed_Noisy_I'm not usually a fan of ponies.
Tirek_Annoyed_Noisy_I've had enough of you trying to manipulate me With that, insincere syrupy sweetness.
Tirek_Annoyed_Noisy_Is this meant to be humorous?
Tirek_Annoyed_Noisy_It is lord tirek, and what is it now?
Tirek_Annoyed_Noisy_Of course it's boring here now, But at least you're not in a cage.
Tirek_Annoyed_Noisy_What are you doing?
Tirek_Annoyed_Very Noisy_What have you done?
Tirek_Annoyed__How could i not? you tell your log every five minutes.
Tirek_Annoyed__No! We should hunt down Twilight Sparkle.
Tirek_Annoyed__None of us can use the Alicorns' magic until we figure out how to handle that fool's ridiculous chaos magic!
Tirek_Annoyed__So we can all be part of the spell.
Tirek_Annoyed__That was your plan?
Tirek_Annoyed__You mean, us?
Tirek_Annoyed__You saw what happened when you tried to take Discord's chaos magic.
Tirek_Annoyed__assuming you even have a plan.
Tirek_Annoyed__i wasn't doing anything of the sort! how dare you?
Tirek_Anxious Shouting__Don't let them escape!
Tirek_Anxious_Noisy_I hadn't, thought of it like that.
Tirek_Anxious_Noisy_Yes, by all means Please, just get on with it!
Tirek_Anxious_Noisy_You're not saying you're friends with, ponies?
Tirek_Anxious_Noisy_uh, not i.
Tirek_Anxious_Noisy_we worked together as you asked!
Tirek_Anxious_Very Noisy_can't, hold, much, longer!
Tirek_Anxious_Very Noisy_it's not big enough for me!
Tirek_Anxious__But taking it all would be madness!
Tirek_Anxious__It's impossible for any other creature to control!
Tirek_Confused_Noisy_i do?
Tirek_Confused_Very Noisy_Fluttershy?
Tirek_Confused__There's a fourth?
Tirek_Confused__Windigos?
Tirek_Happy Shouting_Very Noisy_welcome back, baby!
Tirek_Happy Smug_Very Noisy_And that there is nothing you can do to stop it?
Tirek_Happy_Noisy_It seems my little protegee's plan worked after all.
Tirek_Happy_Noisy_Nothing will give me greater pleasure than to see Their world turned upside down.
Tirek_Happy_Noisy_So she could trap the six of you was inspiring.
Tirek_Happy_Noisy_So. much. power!
Tirek_Happy_Noisy_The irony is too perfect.
Tirek_Happy__Which means, all the power inside is ours for the taking!
Tirek_Happy__i could feel it flowing through my body as i grew!
Tirek_Happy__you should've seen twilight's face, When her friends appeared in bubbles around me.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_After that, we can go back To trying to, destroy each other.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_All magic was a little excessive, don't you think?
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_All of these years, taking power from ponies.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_Amusing.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_But draining your precious world of magic.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_But i might know something about it.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_But we have no time for such things.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_Clearly you've had to abandon your true nature to stay in their good graces.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_Did he succeed?
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_Don't trust anything that nosy little pegasus says.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_Help me to grow strong, and be rewarded With something far greater than, friendship.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_Here, i want you to have something.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_I am lord tirek.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_I am lord tirek.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_I can assure you, i am no friend.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_I give it to you as a sign of my gratitude and loyalty.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_I used that turncoat discord.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_I'll give you your magic back.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_If i had all that magic, Do you think i'd still be locked up in here?
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_If my protege has followed my instructions, by sunset tonight.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_If that's what you want.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_It means the six of you will be trapped here, like me.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_Join me, discord, and reclaim your greatness.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_None of us could make it up alone.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_Not for much longer.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_Now tell me everything you learned today, Leave nothing out.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_Obviously.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_Of course.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, please, i've seen this before.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, we've never met.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_Oh, why not.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_Once i've stripped these ponies of their magic.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_Silly filly.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_So i simply pointed my pen pal in the right direction.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_The princess of friendship, here for a visit.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_Their release, for all the alicorn magic in equestria.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_Then where can we find this, fourth princess?
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_This was given to my by someone very close to me.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_Those ponies have weaknesses.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_Tricked him into helping me capture his so called, friends.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_Unless, of course, pony errand boy is the role You've always wanted to play in this world.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_Wait.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_What have i done to earn the honor of your company?
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_Whatever you command.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_Where is her castle?
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_Who better to do so than the master of chaos himself?
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_Why don't you go and have a little fun?
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_With the princesses out of the way we can now.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_You are discord, you are legend.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_You cannot fall into the same trap that claimed my brother!
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_You're going to give me what i want.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_You've gathered up all of them?
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_i absorbed all the magic of equestria!
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_i can only absorb magic from living beings.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_neither was i, but working together seemed.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_no he didn't.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_oh I should have known you would want to have equestria all to yourself.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_scale the mountain.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_so rather than subject myself to the elements.
Tirek_Neutral_Noisy_you know, working with you two may not be the worst thing.
Tirek_Neutral_Very Noisy_A changeling? see? she gets it.
Tirek_Neutral_Very Noisy_Abandoning his true nature to make, friends, With weak minded equines who offer him nothing.
Tirek_Neutral_Very Noisy_After the way he has betrayed you, you still call him a friend?
Tirek_Neutral_Very Noisy_And i will take what should have been mine long ago!
Tirek_Neutral_Very Noisy_And i will take what should have been mine long ago.
Tirek_Neutral_Very Noisy_And now you are no longer of any use to me.
Tirek_Neutral_Very Noisy_And reclaim your greatness.
Tirek_Neutral_Very Noisy_But that is just what it will be.
Tirek_Neutral_Very Noisy_Freedom.
Tirek_Neutral_Very Noisy_I commend you on your escape.
Tirek_Neutral_Very Noisy_I won't stand in your way.
Tirek_Neutral_Very Noisy_Is he friend or is he foe, the pony wonders.
Tirek_Neutral_Very Noisy_The only one discord betrayed was himself.
Tirek_Neutral_Very Noisy_We're pen pals, Each letter had so many questions about draining magic.
Tirek_Neutral_Very Noisy_What a waste of such delicious power.
Tirek_Neutral_Very Noisy_What can't be right?
Tirek_Neutral_Very Noisy_Who said anything about us?
Tirek_Neutral_Very Noisy_You helped me grow strong.
Tirek_Neutral_Very Noisy_You've provided the means by which i can obtain princess twilight's magic.
Tirek_Neutral_Very Noisy_Your turn!
Tirek_Neutral_Very Noisy_because they are annoyingly lucky.
Tirek_Neutral_Very Noisy_grogar is ancient and extremely powerful.
Tirek_Neutral_Very Noisy_i remember hearing tales of his tyranny, when i was young.
Tirek_Neutral_Very Noisy_i thought that you were a legend.
Tirek_Neutral_Very Noisy_the land that would become equestria, was a mere collection of farms and pastures until he, declared himself emperor of all he saw.
Tirek_Neutral__'Cause when you have to protect yourself.
Tirek_Neutral__Ah, Chrysalis. Another successful field trip, I presume?
Tirek_Neutral__And Grogar's long absence has given me time to prepare the next part of our plan.
Tirek_Neutral__As long as she's out there, she's dangerous.
Tirek_Neutral__As you wish.
Tirek_Neutral__Best we deal with them now.
Tirek_Neutral__But he was always weak minded.
Tirek_Neutral__Delicious.
Tirek_Neutral__Destroy some crops, cause some damage.
Tirek_Neutral__Discord.
Tirek_Neutral__Every last vestige of equestrian magic, Will disappear into the ether, forever!
Tirek_Neutral__Every prisoner is safely in their cells.
Tirek_Neutral__Getting rid of your magic so that i cannot take it from you?
Tirek_Neutral__Grogar's Bell.
Tirek_Neutral__He's lying. He won't tell us.
Tirek_Neutral__Her name is.
Tirek_Neutral__I know.
Tirek_Neutral__It appears we are at an impasse.
Tirek_Neutral__It holds that magic until it is released by this spell.
Tirek_Neutral__It is as worthless as he is.
Tirek_Neutral__Join me, discord,.
Tirek_Neutral__Magic, seasoned with age.
Tirek_Neutral__My brother who betrayed me.
Tirek_Neutral__Now i understand what your fellow princesses have done.
Tirek_Neutral__Now we can hunt down the rest of the.
Tirek_Neutral__She's er, not as annoying as I, expected.
Tirek_Neutral__Smarter than to continue fighting.
Tirek_Neutral__Take my hands.
Tirek_Neutral__That was unexpected.
Tirek_Neutral__The windigos are ancient magic. It would be unwise to leave them unchecked.
Tirek_Neutral__This artifact can steal any creature's magic.
Tirek_Neutral__Thought it was too cold for you to hunt anypony down.
Tirek_Neutral__Us?
Tirek_Neutral__We've been busy.
Tirek_Neutral__Well, i was bored.
Tirek_Neutral__You really think she'd do anything for them?
Tirek_Neutral__You're free?
Tirek_Neutral__it took about five minutes to deduce that grogar was right.
Tirek_Neutral__you don't have time for anypony else.
Tirek_Sarcastic_Noisy_What a pity.
Tirek_Shouting_Very Noisy_Enough!
Tirek_Shouting_Very Noisy_you're annoying and you snore!
Tirek_Shouting__Princess twilight!
Tirek_Shouting__You have something that belongs to me!
Tirek_Smug_Noisy_Clearly, i was right to wait.
Tirek_Smug_Noisy_How does it feel?
Tirek_Smug_Noisy_I decided, to let you two face the danger, Take what you learned, and use it to my advantage.
Tirek_Smug_Noisy_I didn't try to.
Tirek_Smug_Noisy_If you let me out, i'm sure it would jog my memory.
Tirek_Smug_Noisy_Indeed it would. who wouldn't love to see those prissy ponies realize they've lost everything.
Tirek_Smug_Noisy_Well, for you. Sweet revenge for me.
Tirek_Smug_Noisy_What do you say? i scratch your back, you scratch mine?
Tirek_Smug_Noisy_didn't make it to the top? surprise surprise.
Tirek_Smug_Noisy_it seems my little protégé's plan worked after all.
Tirek_Smug_Noisy_no, you're not.
Tirek_Smug_Very Noisy_Give my regards to cerberus.
Tirek_Smug_Very Noisy_How about a trade, princess twilight?
Tirek_Smug_Very Noisy_I doubt this starlight stands a chance.
Tirek_Smug_Very Noisy_Knowing that soon, every pegasus, unicorn and earth pony will bow to my will?
Tirek_Smug_Very Noisy_cozy glow outsmarted the six of you.
Tirek_Smug__A fitting end to your pathetic story.
Tirek_Smug__Didn't you all notice something was wrong in Equestria?
Tirek_Smug__Oh, run along. The big stallions are playing.
Tirek_Smug__The perfect dessert to a legendary meal.
Tirek_Smug__There's no backup friends or rainbow magic to save you now!
Tirek_Smug__This cretin could destroy you before you blink.
Tirek_Smug__Turns out that the Magic of Friendship is your biggest weakness.
Tirek_Smug__Unless you'd prefer I take all the magic myself?
Tirek_Smug__What's it going to be, princess?
Tirek_Smug__so choose your words carefully.
Tirek_Surprised Confused_Noisy_How is this possible? you have no magic!
Tourist Pony_Anxious_Noisy_Do all the dragons at this school suffer from scale issues?
Tourist Pony_Confused_Noisy_I-i'm sorry, did you say fireworks show?
Tourist Pony_Confused_Noisy_Is something wrong?
Tourist Pony_Confused_Noisy_What?
Tourist Pony_Happy_Noisy_Could you slow down a bit?
Tourist Pony_Neutral_Noisy_I don't wanna miss anything.
Tourist Pony_Neutral_Noisy_We've come a long way to see the school.
Tree Hugger_Fear_Very Noisy_Whoa, dude, what is that!?
Tree Hugger_Happy_Noisy_Oh, i like that! it's so in rhythm with my life force!
Tree Hugger_Happy__Cool! like, in another life, maybe?
Tree Hugger_Neutral_Noisy_All he needs is some, like, calming auditory therapy.
Tree Hugger_Neutral_Noisy_Before i can hug you from a place of authenticity.

Trixie_Angry_Very Noisy_I thought i told you to dance!
Trixie_Angry_Very Noisy_Pull, you fools!
Trixie_Angry_Very Noisy_Self absorbed?! why you.

Trixie_Angry_Very Noisy_You two, quiet!
Trixie_Angry__And you can take this horrible, giant caravan with you!
Trixie_Angry__Are you out of your little pony minds!
Trixie_Angry__Unfortunately, it is more nuanced than that.
Trixie_Angry__What is so important that you cannot wait until morning to disturb Trixie?
Trixie_Angry__Why?
Trixie_Annoyed Sarcastic_Noisy_We have no magic, and it's not like my illusions are going to save us.
Trixie_Annoyed Sarcastic_Noisy_Well since you're so concerned about space.
Trixie_Annoyed Sarcastic_Noisy_and i mean, always.
Trixie_Annoyed Shouting_Noisy_At least you don't have to sleep in it with another pony!
Trixie_Annoyed Shouting_Noisy_You can have it all!
Trixie_Annoyed Whispering_Noisy_Can you please lower your voice?
Trixie_Annoyed Whispering_Noisy_Don't even say it!

Trixie_Annoyed_Noisy_How could you say that?
Trixie_Annoyed_Noisy_I don't know, but i'm starting to think you aren't as great And powerful an assistant as i thought.
Trixie_Annoyed_Noisy_I know! but this is my process.
Trixie_Annoyed_Noisy_I thought i was getting the flowering sticks.
Trixie_Annoyed_Noisy_I'll sleep under the stars where at least the wild animals Will be.
Trixie_Annoyed_Noisy_It's a working title.
Trixie_Annoyed_Noisy_Normally, that sort of flattery would suffice.
Trixie_Annoyed_Noisy_Not that you care, wagon trader awayer.
Trixie_Annoyed_Noisy_Oh it is ridiculous. In fact, this whole tour is ridiculous.
Trixie_Annoyed_Noisy_Plus the time i spent flattering and convincing And begging her to share the recipe would be for nothing.
Trixie_Annoyed_Noisy_Practice makes perfect.
Trixie_Annoyed_Noisy_Sleep, well?
Trixie_Annoyed_Noisy_Sleep? because her roommate snores like an ursa major?
Trixie_Annoyed_Noisy_Snips! snails! step forward!
Trixie_Annoyed_Noisy_Starlight!
Trixie_Annoyed_Noisy_Thank you, no.
Trixie_Annoyed_Noisy_That even trixie's made mistakes, ok? are you happy?
Trixie_Annoyed_Noisy_This amulet is defective.
Trixie_Annoyed_Noisy_Trixie is far too exhausted from performing feats beyond imagination. Be gone with you until morning.
Trixie_Annoyed_Noisy_Trixie thought she said the great and powerful Trixie did not want to be disturbed.
Trixie_Annoyed_Noisy_Ugh. you too, discord.
Trixie_Annoyed_Noisy_Well, i'm sorry you're so miserable!
Trixie_Annoyed_Noisy_Well, it's easy when the wagon is a better friend.
Trixie_Annoyed_Noisy_Yes?
Trixie_Annoyed_Very Noisy_No! tea cup! no!
Trixie_Annoyed_Very Noisy_No. tea cup!
Trixie_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Now pull faster.
Trixie_Annoyed_Very Noisy_The great and powerful trixie doesn't trust wheels.
Trixie_Annoyed_Very Noisy_This better not be another false alarm Or the great and powerful trixie will.
Trixie_Annoyed_Very Noisy_You there, what are you doing?
Trixie_Annoyed__And how am i supposed to know where pharynx is?
Trixie_Annoyed__And i wanted to beat her at something.
Trixie_Annoyed__But today we must discuss your dishonest and unfair procurement Of my wagon!
Trixie_Annoyed__By lying down!
Trixie_Annoyed__Ho-hum.
Trixie_Annoyed__I barely even know you!
Trixie_Annoyed__I don't need that old alicorn amulet.
Trixie_Annoyed__I think that's a very good idea.
Trixie_Annoyed__I'm just frustrated.
Trixie_Annoyed__Nopony can do those spells!
Trixie_Annoyed__Of course i am!
Trixie_Annoyed__Ok fine, we're friends.
Trixie_Annoyed__Ooh! details!
Trixie_Annoyed__Starlight, if you woke me up to play guessing games.

Trixie_Annoyed__What do you want?
Trixie_Annoyed__You and i have some unfinished business.
Trixie_Annoyed__You might have thought to make a reservation.
Trixie_Annoyed__happy?
Trixie_Annoyed__it would have never traded you away.
Trixie_Anxious Annoyed_Noisy_What kind of plan?
Trixie_Anxious Confused_Noisy_Starlight?
Trixie_Anxious Confused__Um, why are they looking at me like that?
Trixie_Anxious Surprised__That was just a baby?
Trixie_Anxious Whispering_Noisy_He's probably already been captured.
Trixie_Anxious Whispering_Noisy_I thought we agreed you'd tell thorax He had to kick his brother out of the hive.
Trixie_Anxious Whispering_Noisy_It's just lucky we're all over here And they're all over there.
Trixie_Anxious Whispering_Noisy_Starlight!
Trixie_Anxious Whispering_Noisy_What are you doing?
Trixie_Anxious Whispering_Very Noisy_i mean, what do we, We have to tell twilight!
Trixie_Anxious_Noisy_And how are we supposed to destroy the throne When we find it?
Trixie_Anxious_Noisy_And i'm sure we'll find out that waiting in that Super long line was worth it.
Trixie_Anxious_Noisy_Are you ok, starlight?
Trixie_Anxious_Noisy_But the changeling's have all of the princesses. we're doomed!
Trixie_Anxious_Noisy_Did i save us?
Trixie_Anxious_Noisy_Haycakes and juice.
Trixie_Anxious_Noisy_He's gone.
Trixie_Anxious_Noisy_Heh heh.
Trixie_Anxious_Noisy_I can't deal with this. i'm just a performer. This is, this is princess level stuff.
Trixie_Anxious_Noisy_I didn't know you had one, granny smith!
Trixie_Anxious_Noisy_I don't know what's happening!
Trixie_Anxious_Noisy_I don't understand why you're all so mad at me!
Trixie_Anxious_Noisy_I think i have a pretty good idea where she might be.
Trixie_Anxious_Noisy_I, i-i'm sorry. i had no idea you felt that way.
Trixie_Anxious_Noisy_Is uh, that the last of the hay cakes?
Trixie_Anxious_Noisy_Kidding.
Trixie_Anxious_Noisy_Me? no.
Trixie_Anxious_Noisy_Now what?

Trixie_Anxious_Very Noisy_Everypony with powerful magic is already gone!
Trixie_Anxious_Very Noisy_How?
Trixie_Anxious_Very Noisy_I don't think we'd be able to find our way without you.
Trixie_Anxious_Very Noisy_I think i have a pretty good idea where she might be.
Trixie_Anxious_Very Noisy_If starlight says you're on our side, i believe her, but Maybe just stay over there for now, ok?
Trixie_Anxious_Very Noisy_Now Everything, Fits just, Fine!
Trixie_Anxious_Very Noisy_The great and powerful trixie Requires a little assistance.

Trixie_Anxious__But we still don't know where we're going.
Trixie_Anxious__Gone like gone.
Trixie_Anxious__I can't, i never have. No one can vanquish an ursa major. I just made the whole story up to make me look better.
Trixie_Anxious__I don't know how he did it.
Trixie_Anxious__I might share a bit of the blame For pressuring you into leaving work early.
Trixie_Anxious__It's just so far away.
Trixie_Anxious__Nopony does a great and powerful escape like Trixie.
Trixie_Anxious__Oh no it, isn't that.
Trixie_Anxious__Oh, right.
Trixie_Anxious__Oh, saying that didn't help, did it.
Trixie_Anxious__One of the changelings said pharynx left the hive for good.
Trixie_Anxious__Our world famous chant of friendship That we do all the time because we're such great friends.
Trixie_Anxious__Please tell me thorax also mentioned a terrifying looking Changeling who greets visitors but is actually nice?
Trixie_Anxious__Stand back.

Trixie_Confused_Very Noisy_This, this can't be!
Trixie_Confused__But, what about the pony with the ten instruments?
Trixie_Confused__Tickles?
Trixie_Confused__how did you do those spells?
Trixie_Fear Whispering_Noisy_Starlight?
Trixie_Fear_Noisy_A spark of magic Could be very helpful right about now!

Trixie_Happy_Noisy_I was hoping i might convince my great and powerful assistant To come along.
Trixie_Happy_Noisy_It's always nice to come to ponyville And perform with my great and powerful assistant.
Trixie_Happy_Noisy_Nope, but i did think we could stop for cinnamon nuts While we're out.
Trixie_Happy_Noisy_Not just a promise. a great and powerful promise!
Trixie_Happy_Noisy_Of course.
Trixie_Happy_Noisy_Real magic! c'mon. be impressed by me!

Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_A few hiccups always happen.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_And are trying hard to be better.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_And i miss spending time with you.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_And i thought we were both looking forward to missus cake Teaching us the secret recipe To her famous spring solstice cake.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_And now, i just have to teleport it back.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_And we promised to make a cake, not buy a cake, And the great and powerful.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_And we share a love for prestidigitation.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_And we're self conscious about everypony judging us, Even though we've both changed.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_And with all of your students home for the holiday, I won't have to worry about you being summoned To your office in the middle of it.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_And with starlight helping, it might take slightly longer, But i guarantee you we can do it.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_And you're not backing out?
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_And, also i fell asleep.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Are you kidding?
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Are you sure that last thing is real?
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_As great and powerful as i am.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_As much as i love my one pony show.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_At a certain point, i don't even like traveling with myself.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Awwww. that was a really sweet story until the end.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Because you seem a little, what's the word?
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Behold, visiting friend from starlight's past, And be amazed, by the great and powerful And current best friend of starlight.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Besides, we still have enough for.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Best friends who share a deep bond But weren't prepared for the emotional challenges Of traveling.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_But always being at work isn't fair to anypony.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_But er starlight has something she'd.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_But i might have been thinking about how i'd treat myself To a nice brooch instead.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_But it won't work.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_But then i remembered, you never get mad at me.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_But we are definitely set for breakfast.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_But yours is a more, emotionally traumatic answer.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Challenge accepted.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Concentrate on teleporting, got it. doin' the spell!
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Darn, i could've have sworn it'd be At the ice cream parlor because it was warm In the castle and i thought i wanted ice cream.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Definitely ten.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Did your saddle bag just glow?
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Do you know who twilight sparkle is?

Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_How can we help?
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_I give you.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_I guess we'll have to re-supply.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_I have no idea.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_I have this!
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_I have to say, i'm really not as impressed with your friends As the rest of equestria is.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_I mean it won't be as impressive but, ok.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_I mean, of course you brought luggage.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_I nominate you!
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_I often seek the privacy of the orchard to practice New feats of amazement.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_I spend a lot of time on the road with my wagon, So it might be a tad messy.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_I was just about to set out on tour.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_I was thinking about how glad i am to have met you.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_I'll take it.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_I'm all for second chances, third even, But he just seems like a bad bug.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_I'm still craving them. they'd go so well with cinnamon nuts.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_I've got you covered.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_I've learned the hard way, that life on the road requires very Specific supplies, and we only have so many bits.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_If anypony is going to teach me How to do a disappearing spell.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_If he keeps sticking up for pharynx, The hive might decide they don't want thorax as their leader.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_If you have to go to the dinner, I completely understand.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Is there something i can do To make things more comfortable for you?
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_It does sound like a lot, but.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_It is shelter.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_It's fine.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_It's true.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Klutzy.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Looking for somepony?
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Magic is the most important element of friendship.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Many fans, you say?
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Maud needs streamers for the decorations, Sunburst wants us to pick up a genuine, pre equestrian, Spring solstice chafing dish from the antique shop.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Me neither. but somepony probably should.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Mmm yes! i got them from the cart outside.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Mudbriar wants a bouquet of flowering sticks, Whatever that means.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_No fruit calls in my class.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_No no no no. the great and powerful trixie Goes big or not at all! just tell me how you do it.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_No one is.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Not gonna lie, hearing you and those random ponies Say all those terrible things about me, wasn't easy.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Not quite.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Now, now. save your gasps for when i defy the beast's Jaws of doom, and appear inside that black box.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Obviously you and i hit it off.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Of course, being a school counselor is a big responsibility.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Of course, i feel nothing but admiration for the work you do, but it is a little all consuming.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Of course, i love visiting new and exciting places, I am a traveling magician after all.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Oh i don't know, starlight.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Oh no no no, I always buy my haycakes here.

Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_One caravan for two all set!
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Oooh. that looks like it hurts.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Perfect.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Relax. if anything breaks, Starlight will just go back in time and fix it.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Right. like when you were so upset that cutie marks Took away your friend, your magic was strong enough To enslave an entire village.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Rocks and shade.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_See? i'm already learning.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_She made me unsure about my place in the world, Which led me to act out against her.

Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Starlight has always gone out of her way For her students.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Starlight, i can't put a trick that's not working Into my act.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Starlight, why didn't you tell me How much sunburst and i had in common?
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Starlight, you didn't abandon her.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Starlight, you got us this far with just my illusions And discord's annoying personality.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_Sure, the wagon's right around the corner.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_The good news is, i'm so exhausted i could sleep Through a stampede of wild boars.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_The great and directionally astute trixie says We go left!
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_The great and powerful trixie?
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_The kind with too much on her plate.

Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_for a minute I didn't think you were coming back And that you might be upset with me for some weird reason.
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_how come it's not working?
Trixie_Neutral_Noisy_starlight had to choose between you and me.
Trixie_Neutral_Very Noisy_After the manticore chews you up and swallows you, You magically step out of a box On the other side of the stage.
Trixie_Neutral_Very Noisy_And i added the special effects.
Trixie_Neutral_Very Noisy_And now, i'm proud to introduce My great and powerful assistant.
Trixie_Neutral_Very Noisy_But saddle arabia is much farther than my usual route.
Trixie_Neutral_Very Noisy_But, i'm not the best.
Trixie_Neutral_Very Noisy_Everypony always says they'll give you a second chance, But deep down, they never forget.

Trixie_Neutral_Very Noisy_Wait for it.
Trixie_Neutral_Very Noisy_We walk?
Trixie_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well gee, you probably should have told me all the steps Before you let me do the spell.
Trixie_Neutral_Very Noisy_Well, we've both made not so great choices in the past.
Trixie_Neutral_Very Noisy_When Trixie is through, the only thing they'll call you is loser.
Trixie_Neutral_Very Noisy_Yes, well, before we throw away the magical items it's taken me Years to collect.
Trixie_Neutral_Very Noisy_You are supposed to blast yourself into the open mouth Of a hungry manticore.
Trixie_Neutral_Very Noisy_You know, figuring out the best way to do something, Before you actually do it?
Trixie_Neutral_Very Noisy_starlight glimmer!
Trixie_Neutral_Very Noisy_we could try switching hammocks.
Trixie_Neutral__Ahem. teleport.
Trixie_Neutral__But i needed to hear it.
Trixie_Neutral__Can you keep a secret?
Trixie_Neutral__Dangerous?
Trixie_Neutral__Exactly!
Trixie_Neutral__Excuse me, our lives.
Trixie_Neutral__For me, they're all one of those days.
Trixie_Neutral__How about, you!
Trixie_Neutral__How long do i have to wait for my applesauce facial?
Trixie_Neutral__I do not know.
Trixie_Neutral__I guess that would work.
Trixie_Neutral__I have a lot of experience telling ponies That i have experience with the dangerous creatures Of everfree forest.
Trixie_Neutral__I know how hard you've been working lately, So i figured you could use a break.
Trixie_Neutral__I know you're afraid to be in charge, But you're really good at it. listen to your best friend.
Trixie_Neutral__I made a whole table go poof! that was pretty impressive.
Trixie_Neutral__I remember what i was thinking about!
Trixie_Neutral__I'm going to start coming here every time i visit ponyville.
Trixie_Neutral__I'm sorry.
Trixie_Neutral__If i lose, i won't set hoof in ponyville again.
Trixie_Neutral__If i tried it, i'd get chewed up and swallowed By that manticore.
Trixie_Neutral__It is my only friend in the long and lonely nights on the road.
Trixie_Neutral__It is transportation.
Trixie_Neutral__It's a working title.
Trixie_Neutral__Listen, i'd take that over the boring pony You were becoming any day.
Trixie_Neutral__Maulwurf. uh huh.
Trixie_Neutral__No. but usually, when there's a dangerous creature In the forest i don't want to meet, This is how i meet them.
Trixie_Neutral__Nopony is saying your job isn't important, But plans you make with your friends are important too.
Trixie_Neutral__Oh, you need some snacks to give to twilight?
Trixie_Neutral__Only when i'm wearing a soul sucking evil amulet, So, i don't think that counts.
Trixie_Neutral__Ooo, great question. i wish you'd asked it, like, Right after i did the spell, i don't remember anymore.
Trixie_Neutral__Our friendship is stronger than a few angry words.
Trixie_Neutral__Problem solved.
Trixie_Neutral__Snips. snails.
Trixie_Neutral__So, i'd understand if you didn't want to be friends.
Trixie_Neutral__Sunburst is coming to town.
Trixie_Neutral__Teach away, mini twilight.
Trixie_Neutral__Thanks.
Trixie_Neutral__That seems a little extreme.
Trixie_Neutral__That, and the fact that you forgive me every time.
Trixie_Neutral__The great and powerful trixie has come to perform A new stage show of grand illusion.
Trixie_Neutral__The moon shot manticore mouth dive.
Trixie_Neutral__The party maud and mudbriar are throwing?

Trixie_Neutral__We've been popping all around equestria And we still have to walk.
Trixie_Neutral__We've had our differences.
Trixie_Neutral__Well, it was behind the apple it was bound to happen.
Trixie_Neutral__Well, not exactly straight starlight.
Trixie_Neutral__What matters is twilight gave me a second chance, and i appreciate it.
Trixie_Neutral__Whoops, i guess i pictured a tea cup poodle.
Trixie_Neutral__Witness, my subjects.
Trixie_Neutral__You and i promised to make the cake?
Trixie_Neutral__You don't need magic to figure out what to do next.
Trixie_Neutral__after our falafel purchase, We weren't able to get everything on my list.
Trixie_Neutral__and, Nopony's ever offered to help before.

Trixie_Whispering__But even trixie's made mistakes. ha, i know!
Trixie_Whispering__Don't you ever tell another pony i said this.
Trixie_Whispering__One of who?
Trixie_Whispering__The trick is to just move on and pretend they never happened.
Trouble Shoes_Annoyed_Noisy_Say what?! I may be dressed like one, but I ain't no rodeo clown.
Trouble Shoes_Annoyed_Noisy_Tell that to the flank! Upside-down horseshoe, bad luck.
Trouble Shoes_Neutral_Noisy_Bad luck would strike again.
Trouble Shoes_Neutral_Noisy_But my cutie mark's an upside-down horseshoe, and that means bad luck.
Trouble Shoes_Neutral_Noisy_Didn't even finish my routine 'cause right then I knew bad luck was my fate.
Trouble Shoes_Neutral_Noisy_Follows me wherever I go like sour on old milk.
Trouble Shoes_Neutral_Noisy_Had some hot cider a-cookin' in the kitchen. Doubt it survived.
Trouble Shoes_Neutral_Noisy_I ain't gonna rise to greet y'all. Awfully rude, I reckon, but as you can see, I'm the fresh casualty of an unusually unfortunate circumstance.
Trouble Shoes_Neutral_Noisy_I can still remember them judges a-laughin'.
Trouble Shoes_Neutral_Noisy_Just my lot in life, I reckon.
Trouble Shoes_Neutral_Noisy_Just my luck. I was hopin' you'd say no.
Trouble Shoes_Neutral_Noisy_Listen, y'all, I'm a known criminal. How you proposin' on gettin' me into a rodeo?
Trouble Shoes_Neutral_Noisy_My kind of luck he'd think that.
Trouble Shoes_Neutral_Noisy_My lot in life, I suppose.
Trouble Shoes_Neutral_Noisy_So I'd sneak down and have a look, and wouldn't you know it?
Trouble Shoes_Neutral_Noisy_That fire for rodeo never did leave me, though. Couldn't keep away from 'em.
Trouble Shoes_Neutral_Noisy_That's me.
Trouble Shoes_Neutral_Noisy_Typical. Bad luck never rests.
Trouble Shoes_Neutral_Noisy_Y'all best vamoose before my bad luck rubs off and sticks to y'all.
Trouble Shoes_Neutral_Noisy_so I kept on sneakin' back and makin' a big old mess of things.
Trouble Shoes_Neutral_Very Noisy_And finally, I wrangled up the guts to audition for rodeo school.
Trouble Shoes_Neutral_Very Noisy_And wouldn't you know it? In a flash comes this here cutie mark.
Trouble Shoes_Neutral_Very Noisy_But o' course I do. Wouldn't you know it? My lucky day.
Trouble Shoes_Neutral_Very Noisy_Of course guests would arrive while I ain't got no pie to offer. Scores more misfortune points for old Trouble Shoes.
Trouble Shoes_Neutral_Very Noisy_Right in the middle of that tryout, I knew I was doin' what I was meant to.
Trouble Shoes_Neutral_Very Noisy_When I was a colt, I wanted to be a rodeo star somethin' fierce, but I just didn't seem to have the knack for it.
Trouble Shoes_Neutral__Ain't no need. Can hear the rodeo just fine from this vantage.
Trouble Shoes_Neutral__I just ain't never loved nothin' like I love the rodeo.
Trouble Shoes_Neutral__I know it now, I didn't mean no harm, honest!
Trouble Shoes_Neutral__I'll see to it that I take my medicine and square my accounts.
Trouble Shoes_Neutral__Turns out I was just a-lookin' at my cutie mark all wrong.
Trouble Shoes_Neutral__What she says is true. This here entertainin' y'all with my klutzin'? That's what I was supposed to be doin'.
Trouble Shoes_Neutral__Y'all like stories?

Twilight_Sparkle_Amused_Noisy_She really did think of everything.
Twilight_Sparkle_Amused_Noisy_Since when?
Twilight_Sparkle_Amused_Noisy_Stage fright isn't a disease, pinkie.
Twilight_Sparkle_Amused_Noisy_That's not magic, that was just pinkie.
Twilight_Sparkle_Amused_Noisy_The map doesn't really work like that.

Twilight_Sparkle_Amused_Very Noisy_Ever seen one pony play ten instruments?
Twilight_Sparkle_Amused_Very Noisy_I don't think that's going to work.
Twilight_Sparkle_Amused_Very Noisy_I'm afraid no matter how hard you try, The only way to pull something like that off Is if there's more of you to go around.
Twilight_Sparkle_Amused_Very Noisy_It's okay.
Twilight_Sparkle_Amused_Very Noisy_Maybe Zecora cursed my hair.
Twilight_Sparkle_Amused_Very Noisy_Oh, these aren't for you spike.
Twilight_Sparkle_Amused_Very Noisy_Well when you say it like that, it does sound kinda silly.
Twilight_Sparkle_Amused_Very Noisy_What are you gonna say next pinkie, That we all have to drink some weird potion to break the spell?
Twilight_Sparkle_Amused_Very Noisy_What's funny about that?
Twilight_Sparkle_Amused_Very Noisy_Who can really say who said what? i know i can't. can you?
Twilight_Sparkle_Amused_Very Noisy_You too?
Twilight_Sparkle_Amused__A bit?

Twilight_Sparkle_Amused__Come on, twilight. applejack wouldn't lie.
Twilight_Sparkle_Amused__Come on, you'd have to be a complete crazy pony To think he'd do something like that!
Twilight_Sparkle_Amused__Everything's gonna be fine!
Twilight_Sparkle_Amused__Except that all the other racers just passed you!
Twilight_Sparkle_Amused__I see.
Twilight_Sparkle_Amused__I think you can light some fireworks.
Twilight_Sparkle_Amused__I'll keep that in mind.
Twilight_Sparkle_Amused__If it were easy to learn, we wouldn't need a school.
Twilight_Sparkle_Amused__If only i had learned this lesson a week ago, We wouldn't have had to go through all this.
Twilight_Sparkle_Amused__It's okay, Rarity. I was just joking.
Twilight_Sparkle_Amused__Let's get you home.
Twilight_Sparkle_Amused__Let's not get carried away.
Twilight_Sparkle_Amused__Now will you take down my letter to princess celestia?
Twilight_Sparkle_Amused__Oh no.

Twilight_Sparkle_Amused__She's only staying for the week.
Twilight_Sparkle_Amused__Spike, i'm the princess of friendship, i don't get jealous.
Twilight_Sparkle_Amused__That is not the point of my story.
Twilight_Sparkle_Amused__That's a pretty great thing to have in common, if you ask me.
Twilight_Sparkle_Amused__That's up to you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Amused__What do you mean? you've been doing them all day.

Twilight_Sparkle_Angry_Noisy_And neither should you!
Twilight_Sparkle_Angry_Noisy_Because Zecora is an evil enchantress who cursed us, and was gonna cook you up into soup.

Twilight_Sparkle_Annoyed__So who else do i know Who understands strange and powerful magic?
Twilight_Sparkle_Annoyed__So you've been setting her up to fail?
Twilight_Sparkle_Annoyed__Someone woke it up.
Twilight_Sparkle_Annoyed__Spike, I don't know what upsets me more.
Twilight_Sparkle_Annoyed__Spike, that's enough.
Twilight_Sparkle_Annoyed__Spike, there are no zombie ponies.
Twilight_Sparkle_Annoyed__Spike. you can open your eyes.
Twilight_Sparkle_Annoyed__Starlight!
Twilight_Sparkle_Annoyed__That just about covers it.
Twilight_Sparkle_Annoyed__That you deliberately tried to set up Owlowiscious.
Twilight_Sparkle_Annoyed__The answer is still no!
Twilight_Sparkle_Annoyed__This is exactly why I didn't want you to make friends with trixie.

Twilight_Sparkle_Annoyed__Which are as make-believe as curses. This book is just a bunch of hooey.
Twilight_Sparkle_Annoyed__Who are you talking to?
Twilight_Sparkle_Annoyed__Why are you doing this?
Twilight_Sparkle_Annoyed__Will you let me do this?
Twilight_Sparkle_Annoyed__Without spike, I can't get a message to the princess in saddle arabia.
Twilight_Sparkle_Annoyed__Yes, since then.
Twilight_Sparkle_Annoyed__You just decided to skip our dinner without telling me?
Twilight_Sparkle_Annoyed__You're in for it now.

Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_I.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_If it dies, equestria will suffer.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_If only he were awake!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_If party favours sees how much we really do like each other, even though we're all different.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_If starlight keeps doing the same thing in the past.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_If the disaster wasn't caused by cerberus getting loose.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_If tuesday's tomorrow, And the disaster happens by tuesday morning.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_If we keep stopping to have fun, we're never going to get to the fun things i've got planned!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_If you don't mind, has there been any sort of, Trouble here lately?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_If you don't rest, your symptoms will only get worse.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_If you had taken the official test today.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_If you're a statue, that's all lost.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_In fact, i'm less sure now than i was this morning!

Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_It could be dangerous.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_It just doesn't feel right not getting to spend such a special day with my ponyville friends.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_It really is time for starlight to go, isn't it?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_It would be so much work.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_It'll be all over! my time in ponyville, my advanced studies!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_It's a trap!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_It's almost tuesday morning! the disaster could happen at any moment!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_It's awful, it's horrible, it's tragic!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_It's gotta be here somewhere. it's just gotta be!

Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_It's important to all of you And i just can't stand to disappoint any of you And giving me gifts and doing me favors won't make any difference.

Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_It's too late. the yaks left on the last train.

Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_Just one spark.

Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_Winter is coming!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_Without Rainbow Dash, we can't use the Elements.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_Without magic there's no way we'll get back To the school in time.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_Wondering why their supposed friend would treat them so badly!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_Yes, and the books on rare diseases, The books on rare plants And the entire section on bog habitation.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_Yes, but the ones in there have a special canterlot library-y smell!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_You can't be such a pushover, fluttershy.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_You didn't do anything wrong.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_You do?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_You don't think they're running an actual friendship school, Do you?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_You don't understand spike! I have a perfect library book return record!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_You heard her. she says she works alone!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_You in here?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_You know how much i love details!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_You know, that might explain why your appearance Was met with.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_You mean, the more things a dragon collects, The bigger and greedier he gets?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_You sure you're okay with this?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_You two probably need all kinds of help!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_You want me to help protect an entire empire?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_You wanted their magic.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_You wanted to see me? to give me a test?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_You wanted to see me? to give me a test?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_You'll make them forget all about this afternoon, right?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_You're not a liar.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_You're sure you don't want to return it and get that perfect record back?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_You've got to listen to me!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_You've gotta find a way to get our cutie marks back.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_You, are Miss harshwhinny, the equestria games inspector, Aren't you?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_Yup.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_Zecora! apple bloom has cutie pox!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_again.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_and my late fines are already up another twenty six more bits!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_and now it's gone.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_and there's still so much to figure out!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_and they're all orange! how will everycreature color code their notes!?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_and this one, has been overdue since i left for ponyville!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_and to protect celestia's castle!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_but hurry up! we're almost to the best part!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_but now i know something did happen.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_but that's not.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_but the dragonlands are really far for you to go by yourself.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_but the tree couldn't have called you. it's gone.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_but we can't just sit here and let sombra make slaves of every pony we love.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_but, there was ooze all over the place!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_could anything else possibly go wrong!?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_course i was.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_discord! what are you doing here!?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_don't pull any punches with those names, do ya?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_dusty pages prided herself that no books were damaged Or lost on her watch.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_er, Starswirl!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_even if we figure out how to defeat sombra and bring everypony back to ponyville.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_even worse, her record will remain imperfect.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_every part of it failed? oh, now i'll never get the crown!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_fluttershy! not you too!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_fluttershy?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_ha ha ha, nice try, but running a school and running a country are two very different things.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_hang on, i had talk to starlight written down on one of these. just let me find it so i can cross it off.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_he's right. with the elements gone, i don't know how we can defeat him.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_hey, pinkie. sorry i accused you of misjudging gilda.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_however much it is, i'll cover it.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_i can't believe that my carelessness sent her here.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_i don't have a plan, and i don't know what i'm going to do once we get out.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_i don't know what to do. i don't know how to free them and i don't know how to stop sombra!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_i don't know what we'd do without you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_i don't know! i'm not prepared to fight against the citizens of equestria.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_i don't know, but we can't stay here.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_i don't know, i opened the door, and.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_i don't know. the tree of harmony grew the elements, it kept the everfree forest under control.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_i have no idea.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_i really hope everything comes together in time for tomorrow.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_i see. Well chancellor, we have other classes. We can just.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_i think i need some.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_i'm so glad you're ok. we can't beat him without you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_i've never turned in a book even a minute late!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_i, i can't. without the elements my magic isn't strong enough to stop sombra's!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_i, was hoping you'd give me another chance To talk to you about the library book.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_i-i'm happy to help, It's no trouble at.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_if applejack, Pinkie pie, and rarity keep not talking to each other, They could forget what good friends they really are.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_if dusty pages won't go back to canterlot library and explain everything, then she won't be able to get her job back.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_it can't be.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_it's all happening so fast!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_it's just, you've been helping us an awful lot. and we know you have way more important ruler y things to do, so.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_let's hope rarity and rainbow dash had better luck.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_maybe the princesses changed their minds.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_maybe they don't think we're up to the responsibility of protecting equestria after all!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_maybe?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_mister dragon?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_no!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_no! snap out of it you two!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_now you have to listen.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_now, you have to listen to me.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_oh, that might've been useful to look at earlier.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_oh, the decorations, the banquet.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_ok, i'll feel much better.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_overdue!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_pinkie?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_please tell me that scroll says what the royal swanifying is?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_please, I don't have much time.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_rainbow dash, why aren't you in class teaching?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_she's my teacher! Do you know what teachers do to students who don't pass?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_she's worked here forever.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_signed the future sibling supreme?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_so you're saying i should give up?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_so, none of you have been in here before?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_spike where are you going? starlight?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_spike!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_spike! i think i got her fired!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_spike?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_starswirl! the tree of harmony, it's.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_still, twenty isn't enough for the new school year!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_that won't work either.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_that's a fair point.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_there's not enough in the castle kitchens to.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_this happened while we were gone?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_this happened while we were gone?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_those sweets are supposed to be for the princess!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_uh Oh.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_uh huh, would er, you excuse me?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_uhh i mean uh, no books today, heh heh, thanks.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_we can't just stay here.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_we can't reach them.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_we could really use some all powerful lord of chaos help right now!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_we didn't do this, we swear!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_we just wanna talk to dusty pages for a moment!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_we need you!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_well this is exactly what i was afraid of!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_well, i think, you're jealous.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_what will we do if something big happens and the princesses aren't there to help?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_what's going on?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_what's wrong!? what can we do!?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_where do you think she went? crochet? bingo?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_where's spike and fluttershy?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_whoa.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_yes?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_you can do that?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_you can't be ready to step into their horse shoes just like that!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_you did!?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_you sent me to ponyville.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_you're all acting so calm, but this is a big deal.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Noisy_you're stronger than his magic.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Acre of Equestria that is covered in.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Actually, i, uhh!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_All these tunnels, How are we ever gonna find rarity?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Alright. dinner it is!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_And i didn't see a cutie mark.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_And if something that you can't control happens That changes things, work through it together!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_And it's making me nervous!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_And it's not just my friendships That are important to equestria, everypony's are!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_And now that he's starting a new family with this.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_And the book doesn't say anything about having a giant tree branch at your slumber party.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_And there isn't a single mention of the mysterious Chest that came from the tree of harmony.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_And today is.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_And what in equestria is going on in, here?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Apparently they're too rare and too scary to try to talk to us or study.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Apparently you also have to solve a friendship problem.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Applejack, help! Spike's running wild, And i need you to lasso him!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Applejack, what is it?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Applejack?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Are they in danger?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Are those.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Back where you began!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Baking, bffs, brothers.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Because every present i come to is worse than the last!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Been sent, from, canterlot, to.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Both of you, stop!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_But does anypony know what was going on with spike?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_But i do know you can't do this!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_But i forgot to leave time to plan for next month!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_But if he's here, then all the ancient evil creatures that have been imprisoned there could escape and destroy equestria!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_But it's not enough!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_But it's not! i know it's not!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_But just imagine all the others that are Out there waiting for you if you just give them a chance!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_But look at the way i left this place!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_But look at what you're doing!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_But something tells me that opening it is pretty important.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_But spike, rarity's the only one who knows how to find gems.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_But still.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_But that doesn't explain why he keeps grabbing things.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_But that means you might just be the key to stopping all this!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_But that would still leave three disappointed ponies.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_But the map didn't send me. it sent us.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_But there's a catch.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_But we'd better figure it out before it's too late!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_But whatever starlight did in the past changed things here!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_But when i looked again, she was gone!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_But why would she send them back?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_But you put her so high up on the pedestal, You can't even see your own worth anymore!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_But you've pushed your crew to their limit already!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_But, what if i fail?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_But, where's the sixth element?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Can you stop it?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Can't, get a, clear shot.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Causing them to perform All the talents that came with them.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Come inside, girls, quick.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Come on rainbow dash, Keep grinding.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Come on, come on!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Come on, girls. we're all friends here, right?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Come on, spike, this is serious business!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Cutie pox. this puzzling pony plague Afflicted a population of ponies Back in the paleo-pony period.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Did rainbow dash look really young to you?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Discord's turned our dirt roads into soap!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Do you trust us enough to believe we're right?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Does anypony here know how we can tell the real pinkie from all the rest of them?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Does this count as camping?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Don't be afraid.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Don't let them distract you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Don't move!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Don't worry, I'll be back in time for the party.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Don't worry, fluttershy! we'll stop him!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Don't you see?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Each of my friends has taught me something different about myself.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Elements, elements, elements. ugh!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Even if there's a chance chrysalis Will honor her word, shouldn't you try?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Everypony, look out!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Everything we do here in the past, Even the smallest change, Can snowball into an avalanche of trouble for the future!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Exactly! it belongs to the canterlot library. That means it's.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Fight the darkness stygian!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Fluttershy! fluttershy, can you hear me!?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Fluttershy! you have to tell them!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Fluttershy, wait!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Fluttershy, what's going on are you okay!?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Fluttershy?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Fluttershy? what's wrong?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Future twilight looked like she'd been through a horrible ordeal.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Gabby gums doesn't value anypony's privacy.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Girls, why are you all acting like this? We need to stick together.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Go! go!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Guard!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_He could reach the crystal ponies at any moment.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_He's completely out of control! Who knows where he'll go next?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_He's just terrible and, from the looks of it, Completely out of control!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_He's supposed to be guarding the gates of tartarus.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Hello?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Here goes.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Hey! where are you going!?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_How can i stop nightmare moon without the elements of harmony?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_How could i have let this happen?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_How could she be so late to the party?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_How did I not notice?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_How did this happen?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_How do i end this feud if I don't know what it's about?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_How in equestria does that pony expect to pass her history of the wonderbolts exam tomorrow If she's wasting time flying!?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Hurry!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Hurry! hop on!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I came as quickly as i could!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I can't help it spike.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I didn't even know it was gonna happen.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I don't get it. this was supposed to be The most beautiful valley in all of equestria.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I don't know how long i can hold it!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I don't know how we'll break It to ponyville.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I don't know spike, but it looked like She could fly with just magic!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I don't know what starlight's up to yet.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I don't know what we are going to face in there.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I don't know what you went through!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I don't know. think back to last night. Did something happen?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I don't think she's here spike.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I don't understand!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I don't want to live in that awful future we saw!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I don't want to live in that awful future we saw!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I enchanted her and now everypony is fighting over her.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I had no idea that party was so important to her.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I had nothing to report to princess celestia.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I had to pass an entrance exam.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I have no idea.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I have something extremely important to tell you about the future.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I have something extremely important to tell you about the future.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I have to get back to the map So i can stop starlight from changing the past.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I haven't decided who to give the extra ticket to.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I haven't done a thing to prevent the catastrophe!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I hope princess celestia has some ideas.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I just can't help feeling sorry for the ponies featured in her columns.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I just can't seem to get these new wings To do what i want them to do when i want it them to do it.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I just have this nagging feeling we should be looking for something bigger Than loose bolts and leaky pipes.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I just hope it has the answers we need.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I just hope we haven't missed the train.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I just know it.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I knew it was the most important day of my life.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I know! it's hard to believe, but ponies know next to nothing about dragons.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I like gabby gums too, but don't you think she can be a little mean?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I mean, i could give up my ticket and give away two.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I mean, you haven't even met him yet.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I must have caught a particularly strong breeze.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I only have a few seconds, so you've got to listen! Whatever you do, don't.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I only have a few seconds, so you've got to listen! Whatever you do, don't.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I really want to have a reforming spell up and running pronto.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I studied magic for years too. But what i didn't know then was that studying could only take me so far.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I sure hope so!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I think it's feeding off your guilt, princess luna!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I thought if i couldn't find a problem, i'd make a problem.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I was just hoping we would go outside and talk for a bit.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I was so sure it would.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I was sure i saw her, spike.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I'm i'm sure it's just.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I'm just thinking about shining armor.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I'm just worried what she could be up to.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I'm not doing anything!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I'm not sure i can do it.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I'm only now learning how to control my own alicorn magic.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I'm really sorry to bother you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I'm sorry applejack, but we never even got started feeding the pigs.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I'm sorry. i, i thought i'd studied.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I've been looking all over for you ponies, what are you all doing here?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I've been trying to figure out how i'm meant to pass celestia's test.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I've seen it a dozen times!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I've seen you do it! In the future!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_I-i think it's the map! it's calling, you!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_If i can't figure out which one's the real pinkie, i might send her back by mistake!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_If i don't send her a letter by sundown, i'll be.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_If i don't turn in the letter on time, i'll be tardy!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_If the crystal ponies find out that king sombra is trying to take over the empire again.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_If the library in canterlot doesn't have anything, i don't know where else to look!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_If the pillars knew how you felt, I'm sure they wouldn't have turned their backs on you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_If we could just sit down and talk, we could.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_If we hadn't come to help them, they'd still be living under her rules.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_If you break apart again, somepony could get hurt! You should quit, it's not safe!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_If you can't catch her, Discord wins.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Is your knee pinchy now?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_It doesn't seem that my new role as a princess equates to all that much.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_It says here there's no known cure.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_It won't matter if i find the crystal heart. they won't be able to make it work.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_It's a lot harder to freeze an army Of ponies than just six of them!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_It's a test! a test that will determine if you can join the newly formed wonderbolts reserves.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_It's a total mess!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_It's been so terrible so far That it can't possibly end up.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_It's going to be ok! it has to be ok!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_It's like she doesn't even exist.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_It's not their memories, spike.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_It's their true selves that have been altered!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_It's too dark! I can't see!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Just a moment, please!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Keep your eyes open, we don't know what she has planned!

Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_My smarty pants doll.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Nearly all the signs have come true!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Nightmare moon would've wanted the tantabus To turn equestria into a nightmare!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_No pinkie pie? what's this!?

Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Nopony looks at her or says hello or even gives her a smile.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Nor anything about keys to unlock it!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Now it's their turn to help us.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Of course she's gonna say she's the real pinkie! they all do!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Oh boy, i'm feeling very unprepared.

Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Okay ponies, guess it's time to get started.

Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_One hundred wing power!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Ooh, i don't think there's anything in any of my books.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Ooh, this is a job for Spike.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Or at least I haven't found that entry yet.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Or the good, from the bad.

Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Ponyville, The chaos capital of the world?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Ponyville, to be exact.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Princess celestia! wait!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Princess celestia, we came as fast as we could.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Princess luna's turning into nightmare moon, again!

Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Rarity! ow!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Rarity, fluttershy is your friend.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Rarity, it's lovely, but are you sure you'll be ready To open tonight?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Rarity, she was so demanding.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Rarity, what are you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Rarity, you have to listen to me!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Really? you don't say.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Retrieving the crystal heart must be it.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Revenge isn't what you want, friendship is!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_She might banish you from equestria.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_She needs help.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_She needs you, shining armor.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_She's changed, pinkie. she's not evil or scary anymore.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Shining Armor, your horn.

Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Something awful has happened!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Something strange is going on.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Somewhere, else.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Sorry!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Sorry.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Sparkle, and my friends and I are residents here in Equestria.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Speaking of princesses, Aren't you gonna ask celestia for her help as well?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Spike!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Spike!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Spike! are you alright?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Spike! i have horrible news!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Spike! what do you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Spike, can you breathe now?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Spike, i think it's here!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Spike, i'm worried about you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Spike, over here!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Spike, stop! think of the stomach ache!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Spike? what's wrong?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Starlight, you're right!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Starlight?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_That i'm needed in canterlot at once!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_That my entire future would be affected By the outcome of this day!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_That's the prize?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_That's what friendship is!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_That's, kind of what i'm afraid of.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_The Elements.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_The book didn't mention anything about the crystal ponies powering the heart.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_The cab drivers just drive right past to get to the next pony in line!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_The castle of the two sisters!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_The cause of the breakout was never discovered, And the cutie pox disappeared as mysteriously as they arrived.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_The crystal empire's about to be buried Under a mountain of ice and snow!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_The differences between me and my friends Are the very things that make our friendship strong!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_The elements of harmony?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_The heart wasn't missing. it was still in the castle.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_The mail's here already? what time is it?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_The more hate the spirit feels, the colder things become.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_The real question about Cutie mark magic is, Who it seems to affect.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_The shadow isn't who you really are.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_The shadow won't let go of him. He wants to stop, but he can't do it alone.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_The sun should be up by now!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_The whole purpose of the fair is to lift the spirits of the crystal ponies.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Their spirits are going to be anything but lifted.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_There has to be a spell or a remedy in one of my books.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_There is no counter spell!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_There must be some way to just cure you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_There was a page missing.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_There's no time in my schedule to put together another schedule!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_There's nothing in here about branches.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_There's, a pony in there.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_These are all the letters I've written to the princess since I've lived in Ponyville.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_They're changelings, remember?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_They're getting awfully close to the train.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_They've only been gone for a minute, and i already feel like i'm missing something.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Things don't turn out well in equestria without my friends!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_This is all a misunderstanding!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_This is bad. this is very, very bad.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_This is gonna be harder than i thought!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_This isn't a joke!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_This, can't be good.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Trust me, they would never laugh like that Unless something magical was involved!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Tuesday morning, the disaster!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Uh oh. slow down. slow down!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Uh, i just came to welcome you To our celebration.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Uh, maybe on second thought.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Uh, yes?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Wait a minute, everypony!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Wait! don't go!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Wait, we don't know why the map sent us here.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Was she always like this?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_We came as soon as we heard.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_We didn't mean to overwhelm you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_We have to get out of here, Our students can't handle cozy on their own.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_We haven't sent a letter to princess celestia this week!?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_We're here!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_We're, gonna.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_We've come to get you away from discord!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_We've gotta find a way out of here!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_We've just got to talk some sense into them Before somepony gets hurt.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_We've never needed a party so badly.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Well, uh, you see.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Well, we're just gonna have to hoof it!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_What are you doing starlight?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_What are you doing!?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_What are you doing? i asked you to stop fighting.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_What are you doing? what happened to your cutie mark?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_What are you doing? you have to finish your race!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_What do we do?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_What pinkie meant to say was that you were really great!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_What she means is, before you read it, We should probably tell you about.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_What should we do?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_What you're doing goes way beyond cutie marks!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_What's going on now?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_What's inside it how am i supposed to open it?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_What's taking so long?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_What?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_What? no! we only have twenty highlighters!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_When did we send the last one?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Where do we even start?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Where is fluttershy?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Where is rainbow dash? why isn't she handling this?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Where's my calendar? where's my calendar?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Which way are we supposed to go now?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Which way do we go?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Winter needs to be wrapped up, and I'm determined to do my part.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Yes, spike. i couldn't answer your questions.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_You can move, just not toward me!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_You can't give up on your dream.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_You don't look so good.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_You don't need it anymore!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_You gotta help me get that doll away from those girls.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_You have to keep them happy here at the fair.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_You know. 'cause we're friends.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_You might not have enough wing power to create a tornado powerful enough To lift the water to cloudsdale!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_You were so close to the eight hundred wing power minimum.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_You're usually not so, grabby.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_You've gotta give friendship a chance!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_Your spell! perform your spell!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_and the princess is on her way!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_are you all right?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_before rarity finds out how bad we messed up.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_bridlebuck's boat chants, hayhoof's intonements.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_but Fluttershy, the great dragon migration happens only once in a generation. Do you really wanna pass up a chance like that?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_but that's not.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_but what can we do?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_can you help us, please?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_can you hold off the storm?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_come on girls, Princess celestia wants to see us all in canterlot immediately.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_do something, fluttershy! can't you control them?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_everything's got to be perfect.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_how do celestia and luna rule a kingdom and get all this done by themselves every year!?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_i don't know!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_i don't think so. i'm just sorry about your lesson.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_i only hope this spell is the one we need.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_i only read it through once!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_i told you, spike, we're following applejack's list to the letter, and applejack doesn't fly.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_i'll try, but i'm not sure how long it'll take.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_if we can't get them under control before the princess arrives, it'll be a total disaster!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_if we don't stop the forest, there won't be a ponyville to come back to!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_it's a trap!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_it's not your fault, starlight.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_mystic maps and mazes, ugh! anything up there?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_no time for fooling around!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_no.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_none of us were expecting any of this.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_oh, no!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_oh, no! here she comes!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_oops.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_or another pony we weren't expecting?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_or banish you and then throw you in a dungeon In the place that she banishes you to!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_or not.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_please?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_princess celestia will be here tomorrow!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_so much to do not enough time, no! i already did that, wait, nope, i didn't, urgh! not enough time!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_so they can activate the crystal heart.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_sombra's back, and he's taken control of all of our friends!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_spike!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_spike, help me round up these little guys.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_that spell was the only thing we found in the whole library that was even close to what we needed.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_that's cerberus!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_the crystalling!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_the princess could arrive at any moment!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_the princess will be here in a few hours!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_there must be a spell that can restore the crystal heart.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_there's nothing casual about a visit from royalty!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_they're eating the words!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_uh, Gotta go.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_we don't have time to keep rounding up these things!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_we'll probably never see each other.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_we've got to do something.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_well, what are we waiting for?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_what do we do now!?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_what's wrong?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_where did they come from!?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_without the heart, the crystal empire is about to be buried under a mountain of ice and snow!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_you better go with her. spike.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_you're telling me!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious_Very Noisy_zecora, these little guys are devouring ponyville!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Actually, it was me.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Agh! in all the commotion, we forgot we don't have a sun!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Although, what would rarity want?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__An illness? An allergy?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__And applejack will have slaved over those apple brownberries for nothing.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__And even his spell just went back a week!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__And every time you do you send out a terrible cloud of.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__And i don't remember any of them being a staff.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__And i'll be a bad friend.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__And i'll be a worse friend!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__And i've barely been able to pay attention to you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__And it backfired in ways i could never have imagined.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__And it's obvious pinkie really wants us to hit it off.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__And princess celestia will be here any minute And see that i haven't made new friends.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__And that's a long journey.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__And the theme of this vacation is.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__And then spent so much time trying to figure out what we hadn't done and what we had done.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__And when i do choose, Will the other four be mad at me?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__And you know what a nightmare she is with scheduling.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Any, minute, now.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Are you ok?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Are you sure?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Are you sure? absolutely sure?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Because you can't.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Because you're all my friends.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Before I moved to Ponyville, I didn't really know what friendship was.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Besides if you win, you'd have to stay here!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Both for map reasons and because i have no idea.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__But fluttershy, you haven't slept.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__But how am i supposed to beat that amulet?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__But how?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__But i don't understand. where are they?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__But i know they're up to something, And until i find out.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__But i'm not sure i'm comfortable with this.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__But i'm pretty sure metalwork only had eight magical items, not nine.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__But i.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__But if i keep her in the show, she'll be the laughingstock of equestria.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__But if we don't do this, There won't be any apples left for anypony here in ponyville.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__But it could be morning.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__But it could.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__But it could.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__But it didn't explain what's happening now.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__But now it's all happening at once.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__But that means the tantabus could be turning Every dream in ponyville into a nightmare!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__But that was a long time ago!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__But that's not what she was saying!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__But the party! it's all we have left!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__But the tree of harmony! i'm the only one who has seen it and knows what it looks like.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__But there's no way you can do it all on your own.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__But we have an awful lot to do.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__But what if something else came up when we are gone?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__But whoever did it had to have come in here.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__But you could be!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__But you were only trying to help.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__But, does this mean i won't be your student anymore?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__But, the cauldron, the apple bloom soup?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__But, what do i do now?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__But, what if i fail?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__But, what if.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Cadance and i haven't really had a chance to just enjoy being friends again.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Can we talk?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Can't you get rid of them?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Celestia! wait!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Climb over.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Come on Fluttershy.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Come on!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Deal?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Did applejack just.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Didn't you see how they hated Trixie's bragging, Spike?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Discord's still on the loose.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Do you know what this means?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Doesn't that feel wrong too?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Equestria simply can't survive a hundred years in a dark haze.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Even if i make things right.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Even with rainbow dash's replacement, i don't think we're gonna qualify.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Everypony okay?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Exactly how i used to be.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Fantastic. first pinkie races ahead of us, and now fluttershy is lost somewhere behind us.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Fluttershy? Are you okay?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Friendship isn't just for ponies.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Go where?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Great.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Has anypony checked on tirek?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__He's not the only one.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Heh heh. oh, my.

Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Hello? where am i? what is this place?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__How can this be happening!?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__How can you all be so calm about this?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__How could he do this?!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__How could they use friendship as a weapon?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__How do i choose?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__How will we get to the gala?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__How's it going over here?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__How?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I am not all right.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I can't believe it.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I can't believe maud cut her trip short.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I can't decide! i just can't decide!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I can't imagine fluttershy would ever be mean To her animal friends.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I can't risk letting her down!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I can't run a school of friendship Without my best friends.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I can't take it anymore!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I cast a spell to do it for you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I didn't know it was an actual relic!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I didn't know it was an actual relic.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I didn't mean to insult your acting.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I didn't want him to be embarrassed.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I didn't want to believe that you cursed us.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I don't care how it looks!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I don't even know what they do.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I don't know how we'll break It to ponyville.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I don't know how we'll break It to ponyville.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I don't know if we can do this at all.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I don't know what we can do.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I don't know who found you or where they found you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I don't know!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I don't know. rainbow dash? are you okay?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I don't think you're supposed to be any different Than who you are.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I feel like i've abandoned my friends.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I got sucked back into the future before i could explain!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I guess what we're all saying Is that they're just not what we had in mind.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I have a very important message for you from the future!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I hope everything is okay.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I hope it really is just an old pony tale.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I just can't believe it!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I just couldn't stand to see you stuck like that.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I just wish there was a way to do both.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I know this is hard to believe, But you and i and those other ponies i mentioned are friends!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I know what pride he takes in a job well done.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I know, but i really want her visit to go without a hitch.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I mean about the gala and the ticket and who i should take.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I mean, i am, or i, will be.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I mean.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I missed the deadline.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I never would have thought of all this.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I put too much pressure on her.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I read all about the prediction of nightmare moon.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I saw something from a long time ago.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I still don't know what happened to princess luna and princess celestia.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I think something's wrong with pinkie.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I thought i was doing something good, I thought i was helping.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I tried to talk to you all about how I was feeling, but you seemed more worried about what you had to do for the coronation.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I was so focused on doing things the e e a way, I didn't listen to any of you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I was so focused on my studies that i didn't show up.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I was so worried! Where are the princesses?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I was too busy to think about it.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I will always need you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I wish she was here.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I'm afraid to take that chance spike.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I'm calm.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I'm calm.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I'm doing what i can, But it's really up to you at this point!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I'm glad sludge is here.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I'm just afraid of how he'll take it.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I'm just your run of the mill citizen of ponyville. No powerful magic here.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I'm not better than anyone.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I'm not better than anypony else!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I'm not sure anything we know is the same.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I'm so sorry.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I'm supposed to send princess celestia a letter every week telling her about a lesson i've learned about friendship!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I'm telling you the truth!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I've tried everything fluttershy, but none of my study methods work for her.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I, I need some time to think first.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I, uh, I think we should check off truth or dare and move on.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__I-i had to make it work.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__If i go out there and show off my magic, I run the risk of losing them as friends.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__If i tell celestia she's terrible.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__If it falls into the wrong hooves, Equestria will be in grave danger!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__If we do, Equestria will be covered in smoke for the next one hundred years.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__If we don't break the spell they're under, Who knows what terrible things could happen!?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__If we don't, If things don't work out.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__If you think of anything, even the smallest thing.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__If you'll excuse me, i'm going to check the kitchen.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__If you're sure you can handle it.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Is anypony there?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Is something wrong?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Is there a book about being a princess i should read?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Is there something wrong with you?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Is this about the weather, and the animals' weird behavior? What's happening out there? why isn't my magic working? is there.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__It does!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__It is?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__It represents such an essential part of who you are.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__It was supposed to be a simple play!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__It'll hurt her feelings.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__It's bad everywhere.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__It's flim and flam!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__It's for the good of all equestria!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__It's imperative that the princess is told right away!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__It's just not gonna happen.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__It's just so daunting!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__It's just that the summer sun celebration was what first brought us all together.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__It's just that you seem to be doing an awful lot of snoring.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__It's just, i-i got so stressed.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__It's middle of the night.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__It's more than that!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__It's not me!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__It's not your fault. she fooled everypony.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__It's the most horrific trouble i've ever been in and i really, really, really need your help!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__It's where princess luna and princess celestia found the elements, i think it's in danger.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Just a bright light of hope being snuffed.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Just because I'm ready to sit on the throne in Canterlot, doesn't mean I'm ready to leave Ponyville.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Just because things change doesn't mean you leave everything you love behind!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__King sombra's spell must be why their coats aren't, crystally.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Listen pinkie, i don't wanna upset you, But just because rainbow dash has another friend Doesn't make gilda a grump.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Look at her!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Loyalty.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Maybe a little.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__My command!?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__My magic's not good enough.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__My strengths?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__No lookout, no distraction.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__No no no no no no!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__No!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__No, no, no, no, no!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__No.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__No. the princess of friendship can't get jealous!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__None of these books have a cure.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Nopony should trade for my books just because i'm a princess.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Not every other week. not every ten days.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Now what do we do?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Of course you are. and i do have a plan, obviously, But now's clearly not the time to do it, You should enjoy your party.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Of course, i could be wrong.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Oh applejack i wish i could but, this is the dragon code we're talking about.

Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Really girls? are you sure?

Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Releasing the journal was my idea.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Right! Spike!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Run!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Seventeen bits in late fees!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__She will bring about nighttime eternal.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__She's being horrible to everypony.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__She's pinkie pie's sister.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Shouldn't there be some sort of training program?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Simply awful.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__So i cast a secret spell to light it for him.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__So there's only one thing to do.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__So you'd rather leave the School of Magic than make friends?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Something tells me everything is not going to be fine.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Sorry!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Sorry!

Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Spike.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Spike?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Stairs. lots and lots of stairs.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Star swirl's spell! oh no!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Starlight glimmer should be here, any minute.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Stopping Sombra by himself was hard enough! And that was with lord of chaos training wheels!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Surely you know how important the dragon code is to a dragon?
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Tell us what happened Applejack.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Tell us what happened Applejack.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Thank you, really.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__That amulet can reverse the tides and summon tsunamis!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__That must be why their cutie marks are all wrong!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__That's just it, i can't tell!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__That's not how ponies make friends.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__That's ridiculous. a cutie mark can't take your friends away!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__The cut's in the exact same spot as the scar on future twilight's cheek!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__The disaster is still coming!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__The elements! they're gone!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__The last sign has come true!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__The pony who holds my fate in her hooves.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__The spell didn't work.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__The townspeople are furious. we need the old pinkie pie back.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Their destinies are now changed.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Then let's get discord back to ponyville, Make that elixir and finally get a chance to spend some quality time together.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__There's a bit of a problem with her headdress.

Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__They tried to con the apples out of their farm!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__They're gone!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__They're just gonna fight again.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__This is a disaster!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__This is big.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__This is the first royal duty princess celestia has given me.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__This is the ruler of all of equestria we're talking about.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__This isn't you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__This night is extremely important to me discord.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__Those are all pretty good reasons aren't they?

Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__We have to stay as positive as we can.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__We haven't changed the future at all!
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__We made mistakes, and we learned from them.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__We need you to help us defeat him with your element.
Twilight_Sparkle_Anxious__We should be much farther along by now.

Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_A coincidence, nothing else to it.

Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_A good friend can help you rein it in.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_A little quieter, princess.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_A pony whose contributions.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_A whole day to celebrate starswirl the bearded.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_About that, Spike and i were wondering what happened out there.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Absolutely not. time travel is not something to be messed with.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Actually Applejack, I had something else to talk to you about.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Actually where you're going isn't even in equestria.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Actually, i was looking for spike. have you seen him?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Actually, i'm from next tuesday morning. but that's not important right now!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Actually, i'm from next tuesday morning. but that's not important right now!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Actually, it is.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Actually, it's kind of a long story.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Actually, pinkie, i haven't the slightest idea.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Actually, she's not the one.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_After all, everypony is unique, and individual.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_After all, friendship is something That needs to be shared with every, creature.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_After i came to see madame pinkie and the flowerpot landed on my head.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_After this, i move on to the b's.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_After three events in one week, I really needed to relax with a good book.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_After we finish cleaning up.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Ah! you're absolutely right spike. Sometimes it is nice to get out of the library And be in the sun.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Ah, speaking of friends, if you'll excuse me, Important business to attend to!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Aha! here it is!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Ahem! but of course, i'm really here on business.

Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_All this hard work is making me hungry.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Almost as if it has a mind of its own.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Almost everything.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Alright Spike.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Alright, fine. you got yourself.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Also not helpful.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Always glad to pass on my love of learning for learning's sake.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And a good friend, like a good book, is something that will last forever. Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And at the end of each week, we'd add up the stars.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And between the two of us, we should be able to get him to understand why he needs to go.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And clean up.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And don't forget to sample some famous griffon scones. They're supposed to be the best.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And even if my star swirl the bearded costume Didn't go over.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And even though i didn't find anything Out about the mysterious chest.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And even though i want everypony here to be happy.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And i certainly wouldn't be here to stop you now.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And i know just who can help me.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And i mean anything.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And i respectfully ask you to step aside, Or classes will start late.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And i'm happy to see you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And i'm honored. really, i am.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And if spike says thorax is his friend, then he's my friend too.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And if we happen to mention how much her friendship means to us, And how much we'd miss her if she were gone forever.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And in the instance of my friends and i, It can be traced to a single event.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And keep an eye on trixie.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And look for any kind of problem that could lead to a disaster.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And maybe someday, other ponies will read it and learn something, too!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And more efficient.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And my poor baby dragon needs his sleep.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And neither does all this flying business.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And nothing else is, bothering you?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And now that i realize how important friendship is, I'd like to make up for my mistake with a new party.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And now you have all these inside jokes That you seem to be.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And of course you recognize commander easy glider.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And our friendships may be tested, but it will never ever be broken.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And pinkie pie might never have decided to leave hers.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And section two two nine paragraph nine says outdoor activity reinforces learning.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And she taught me a really cool bear game.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And she's always there to help anypony.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And spike.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And stay over break for extra friendship lessons, By yourself.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And sunburst practically knows every spell that ever was.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And take us to their houses.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And that brings me to the second part of the surprise.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And that is why you are my number one assistant.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And that's where you're headed.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And that's why i thought we could use the map to.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And the b a e would never throw in the towel like that!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And the friendship school teacher of the month is.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And there's no doubt you're a part of my mission to spread friendship too.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And there's still so much i'd like to do there.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And they're celestia and luna, So it's not like you can just confront them.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And they're incredibly delicate.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And this is sugarcube corner.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And this time we need to practice the steps.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And though it has been at the, root of magic and friendship From the moment it was planted, its ways are mysterious.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And to have you sign a form for silverstream.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And vapor's so busy making her friend look good, She's not focused on her own flying at all.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And we are not gonna let her down, are we?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And we can talk personal records after class, miss?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And we were wrong.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And we wouldn't be who we are if we didn't go in after her.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And what teamwork activity do you two have planned for today?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And whoever passes gets to stay.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_And with the grand galloping gala coming up, I bet you could totally get some of them To buy your dresses.

Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Anyway, enough about me, I had to check on you Not in a meddling way in a friendly how's it going way So, how's it going?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Applejack might never have realized That she belonged on her farm.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Applejack, can we talk?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Applejack, do you remember when you had to tell everypony That the tonic granny bought from the flim flam brothers didn't really work?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Applejack, who reassured me when i was in doubt.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Applejack, you know you don't have to call me that.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Applejack, you'll buck your way into the sealed tunnels.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Are you sure these are necessary?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Are you sure you can handle it?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Are you sure you don't want to come with us?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Are you sure you're not air sick, big brother?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Are you sure you've never managed a concert before?

Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_As i was saying.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_As in, this afternoon this afternoon?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_As long as it doesn't take too long.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_As princess, i believe i have the power to spread the magic of friendship across equestria.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_As you all know, starlight glimmer has been my pupil For a while now.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Attention, everycreature!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Aw, come on spike, a dance would be nice.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Aw, that's all right.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Aww, no sweet potato muffins?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Back in his day, nopony knew much about the peaks of peril.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Back when we were in school together, You invited me to a party.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Baking with pinkie pie.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Be honest. the only reason you won't drink the potion, Is because deep down in your hearts You know there's a chance that discord has you under his power!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Because it's never called just one of us before.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Before you go, i was wondering if you might be willing to help rainbow dash.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Being able to make those rock candy necklaces together is really important to her.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Believe me spike, If any pony understands what it's like to get caught up in a really good book, it's me.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Believe me, i've thought long and hard about this.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Besides, there's some school business I need to take care of on mount aris.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Besides, this errand is going to be different.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Best aunt ever.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Better. right, fluttershy.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Big brother best friend forever.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Both of you are teamwork experts.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Boy have i.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Bringing with them artifacts and talismans of great power.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But I need more evidence to confirm.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But I've never seen her in ponyville.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But competing is in their nature And it's leading to more and more fights.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But flurry taught me an important lesson today.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But fluttershy, why did you think you needed to be Somepony else to run the shop?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But for now, i need you to pretend you're you and i'm me.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But forget olde ponish, There's parts where his hornwriting is like another language!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But how did you notice?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But i didn't defeat tirek on my own.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But i do have one question.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But i do kind of want to see where it goes.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But i do need to speak with dusty pages about a, ahem, Sensitive matter.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But i don't think it's gonna be that exciting.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But i feel like that only happens if you both let it.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But i feel lucky this time.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But i honestly came on this cruise To take some time off from being a princess.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But i know it couldn't have been just me.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But i never thought she'd cancel her shoot with photo finish.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But i should have stood up for myself So that i could do what i wanted too.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But i thought the fruit bats usually stayed put in the west orchard.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But i want to give whoever caused this mess A chance to tell the truth, and explain themselves.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But i'm not so sure the ponies who care about you want you going off so far on your own.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But i'm sure it's nothing to worry about, starlight.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But i'm sure you, and whoever needs help.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But if i use my magic to help her do something unattractive at her next fashion show, no one will ever want her to model again.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But if we're going to make any progress fixing up luna and celestia's old castle tomorrow.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But if you come on the boat with me, I'll show you what really happened.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But if you still want to search for your real family,
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But in order for the spell to work, I need the bats' full and complete attention.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But instead you chose to compete with your friends.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But it isn't.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But it wasn't her fault.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But it's even harder to fathom what my life would be like.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But maybe you could do a little less smashing in the classroom?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But now you can bring it to canterlot library, And get your job back!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But once she finally forgave herself for what nightmare moon did.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But power isn't why you make friends.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But right now, i gotta go take some pictures, See ya later!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But spending quality time with her.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But suddenly they encountered.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But thankfully you just wore yourself down.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But that doesn't mean they don't have value.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But that's no mystery, that's magic.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But that's ok!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But the fate of Equestria does not rest on me making friends.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But the map picked you two because you're the best ponies to Tackle this particular mission.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But the running of the leaves is a ponyville tradition, and since i'm here to learn, I've decided i should experience it myself.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But then another clue confounded my suspicions.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But then your brain is also absorbing lots of other information.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But there's no doubt it's worth fighting for.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But they'll never get better if they don't know what to work on.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But unlike your hair, confidence is something You can get back right now.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But we haven't tried rainbow dash's way.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But we know you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But we've all got to keep a good pace if we expect to make it up the mountain by nightfall.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But what if a unicorn's special talent is magic?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But whatever it is, i promise i'll always be there for you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But when we were captured by chrysalis, Starlight took charge and really stepped up.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But with the help of my friends.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But you shouldn't be nervous about meeting him.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But you'll have to get past the timberwolves.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But you're still gonna help me practice my lecture.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But you've got this, spike.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But, Well, it doesn't seem like you need any help.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But, pinkie wanted to throw you a real party.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But, since nocreature took responsibility for this mess, You're all gonna have to help clean it up Before you can go home.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_But, this is your mission.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Bye bye!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_C'mon fluttershy.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Call everypony back.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Calm down, everypony. All we know right now is that Pinkie Pie just got a case of the shivers. That's all.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Can you have her back at the castle when we're done?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Can you help me recalibrate the apertures On the nine and quarter catadioptric telescopes?

Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Fluttershy always has some fear she's trying to get over.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Fluttershy might never have discovered her love of animals.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Fluttershy, did you bring your friends?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Fluttershy, help applejack With the trees.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Fluttershy, it was when you realized That the way to show kindness to the breezies, Was by forcing them to leave their home.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Fluttershy, it's me, twilight.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Fluttershy, you're an animal expert.

Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_He's so sweepy, he can't even keep his wittle bawance.

Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Honestly, spike, i don't see why you're being so hard on yourself.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Honorary members too.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Hooray!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_How about if i help clear out the clouds?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_How bad could things be?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_How can i when it's a totally successful vacation?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_How can there be two mes? It's not scientifically possible. You are not scientifically possible!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_How did you know about the thorn?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_How do you keep track without a recipe?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_How long before cadance is ready?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_How long have you been waiting?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_How was the field trip?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_How would it look if i couldn't solve a friendship problem?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_How's that one? too soft? too hard? too lumpy?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_How's that spike?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_How's your trip to ponyville so far?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Huh, i guess you're right, pinkie.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Huh, that's actually kind of interesting.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Huh?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_Hurry up, you don't want late marks on your permanent record.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I actually think That the three tribes could've tried harder.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I almost slammed into that.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I already have a seventy point plan in place For this very situation.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I am happy to report that the dragon has departed our fair country.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I am her student and I'll do my royal duty.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I am so sorry.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I am starving.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I am sure she'll love your rock candy.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I appreciate that.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I bet discord hid the elements in the palace labyrinth.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I bet if we get her to do the stuff she likes and is good at doing, she'll cheer right back up, And forget all about the yovidaphone.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I bet that's exactly what your teachers had in mind.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I bet you're wondering why you're all here again.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I can speak from my own experience That the power of cutie mark magic is very real.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I can take you to it.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I can turn a mare into a stallion.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I can't believe i didn't recognize the alicorn amulet.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I can't believe it.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I can't believe you're laughing at me.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I can't just leave you here to do all that work.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I can't picture anything.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I could send her to the crystal empire To continue her magical studies with sunburst!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I did princess, but I think Rarity learned even more than me.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I did, and i know who you are.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I did, chancellor neighsay.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I didn't want to bring it up but, yeah, it did seem strange.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I do need to be there.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I do.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I don't know about you But i can't make important decisions on an empty stomach.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I don't know how i could have done this without you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I don't know what i'd do without you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I don't know what will happen.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I don't know, but hippogriffs don't have cutie marks.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I don't see anything on them that would give us a clue As to where the keys might be.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I don't think friendship lessons Are enough for her anymore.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I finally untangled that mess of a spell And got everypony home. it was really powerful stuff.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I for one, think you are three very lucky fillies.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I found a spell that makes temporary wings, but it was too difficult to do more than once.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I get it, Things are getting off to a rougher start than expected.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I guess i didn't even notice vapor, I was too busy watching sky.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I guess i hoped we'd get here and the mystery would just Magically be explained.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I guess i just don't really understand why i'm here.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I guess it only works once.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I guess the tree is still alive.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I guess this just teaches us that even longtime friends Need to work at communication.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I guess we don't need to figure out who should get what.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I guess you're right.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I had an epiphany after that flowerpot.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I had no idea you were.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I had years' worth of friendship lessons Ready to go.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I have a feeling it means our work here is done.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I have a lot.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I have something to tell you. all of you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I have to do it the traditional way.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I have you guys, and we have the elements, and together.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I hope so, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I hope you and Applejack don't have any trouble getting home.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I just did.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I just got here to bring you your toothbrush.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I just have a few questions, What time should school start each day?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I just have to feed her real quick.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I just need to think of someplace safe to send her.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I just thought i'd check to see if you and sludge Had any luck turning up your dragonishness.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I knew i could count on you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I knew it!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I knew you'd come to your senses.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I know fluttershy would be thrilled to see another pony win.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I know how we can get out.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I know i've finished one of starswirl's spells before, But this one was on a whole different level.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I know i've heard of the elements of harmony.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I know it sounds crazy.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I know it's a big change, But i think you're gonna fit in.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I know it's not some big adventure against the forces of evil.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I know spike, we're leaving.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I know these two are up to something, I'm just trying to find out what.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I know things haven't gone perfectly so far.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I know you each have a different perspective On how the boat capsized and blame each other.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I know you have to plan the friendship party too.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I know you lost some confidence when you lost your mane.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I know! but i wanna be one hundred percent prepared!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I know, i saw you coming and had to distract thorax By showing him chairs.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I left the other ponies behind giving the games inspector The worst castle tour ever.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I mean i don't know everything.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I mean of course she will.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I mean starswirl was a genius, obviously.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I mean, i'm the princess of friendship.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I mean, that hydra.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I mean, they don't let just anypony be captain of the royal guard.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I mean, what in equestria could be going on there?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I mean, you were me and i was starlight.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I mean, you're me, but i'm me too.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I moved here to learn about friendship.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I need to take a break anyway.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I need to tell you something.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I nineteen!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I owe you all an apology.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I pretty much just have to smile and wave as the dignitaries arrive.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I promise fluttershy, nothing bad will happen to them.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I promise i won't let you down.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I promise you chancellor, My school will help protect equestria.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I realize that now.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I said, are you sure these are necessary?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I said.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I saw the elements of harmony change her back to good.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I should have just come here first.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I suppose it was a long shot.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I suppose we can just use the elements of harmony Against him again if he gets out of hand.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I suppose we have time for a quick game.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I swear.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I think he missed a meal or something.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I think i found something!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I think i know somepony else who might get hurt If that happens.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I think if you just changed your approach a bit, You might be met with a warmer reception.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I think it is pretty clear that my visit with cadance didn't go quite the way i expected.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I think it's more than that.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I think it's time for us to go moon dancer.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I think this is a decision you have to make on your own.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I think we all know how bad rarity's been feeling.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I think we have all the magic we need right here.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I think we might be the only ponies here.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I think we should split up. You enroll in some classes And find out what they're actually teaching.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I think what she's saying is that when we ran in to save apple bloom, we ran into the poison joke.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I think you might be surprised.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I think you'll all enjoy the time off To be home with your families.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I think you'll find my curriculum Meets all your requirements, chancellor.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I think you're all over reacting.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I thought about having my birthday outside, But they're having another party on the castle grounds today.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I thought i saw something last night in the horsehead nebula.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I thought the wonderbolt reserves were here to help.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I truly believe you need to go on this quest, And we have no right to stop you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I trust you to run this school exactly as i would.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I try.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I understand.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I used to get terrible break outs.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I want this present to say, i'm so proud of you, Both as a mentor and a friend.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I want to know how these, funny moments you shared came to pass.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I want you to continue the search for princess luna and princess celestia.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I was afraid you'd be upset.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I was calling out for you when you were turning this place upside down.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I was so afraid of being thought of as a show off that I was hiding a part of who I am.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I was so intrigued by Trixie's bragging that I was compelled to do a little reading up on them.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I was speaking in a broader sense.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I will give you my magic.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I will not fail to do my duty!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I wonder which cute, little, furry creatures i've awoken.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I wonder which team vest i'll be wearing.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I wouldn't have asked you here if it wasn't important.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I'd better stay longer to help give him a bath too!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I'd really like to spend the rest of the cruise, Relaxing, with my family.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I'll be at the library in no time.

Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I'll take care of the whole fighting for friendship thing myself.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I'll tell you what we've learned, Discord.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I'm a little nervous since that's all i could find.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I'm afraid i'm going to have to ask you To stay away from my school, And my students.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I'm afraid not.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I'm an impartial third party.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I'm certain this is what Discord's riddle really meant.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I'm close to an answer, I can feel it.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I'm familiar with loads of legends and i never heard of.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Noisy_I'm glad spike brought you here, sludge. I understand you made quite an impression in town.

Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_I could use a come to life spell.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_I didn't realize how hungry i was.

Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_I know. and i think it's my fault.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_I may be the princess on a duty, but i don't think that means i have to sit up there all alone doing nothing.

Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm sure maud was just nervous about meeting all of us.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm sure no other pony will even notice i'm here.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm sure she'll have some ideas.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm sure shining armor and princess cadance will love all our gifts.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm sure they'd appreciate any notes from you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm sure.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_I've already got applejack and her family rounding up all the pinkies.

Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_If fluttershy says it's all right.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_If for some reason the king can't help, I'd try the griffonstone library next.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_If he is staying calm and collected, I bet he is doing a terrific job as a leader.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_If i can just remember.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_If king sombra can't get in, then it must already be protected!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_If our friends could enjoy three full days with discord that much, It must have something to do With the specific things they did together!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_If pinkie pie says she'll be back In time for the party, she'll be back.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_If we didn't tell pinkie pie that we hadn't all become the best of friends, i think maud would have.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_If you're feeling lonely And you're still searching for your true friends.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_In fact, by using her wits, A seemingly defenseless pony Can be the one who outsmarts and outshines them all.

Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_In my world, my friends and i found the elements, And used them to defeat you!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_In other words, you shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth.

Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_a mark of one's destiny singled out alone fulfilled.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_actually, i have.

Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_and i'm not gonna fail my test!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_and if i could continue the story, we might just find out what they are.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_and now a simple teleportation spell should.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_and that's why we're giving you this.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_anything that got in the way of that was a waste of time.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_applejack and pinkie, you distract him.

Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_especially an obvious clue like.

Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_i mean, it's just feeding the pigs. how hard can it be?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_i think the princess can handle it.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_i think what spike is trying to say is that everypony has their reasons for doing things. even snowfall.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_i think what spike means to say is.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_i think you're right!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_i thought you might want them back.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_i'll cast a spell to make them stop eating all the food!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_i'll retrieve the heart.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_i'm sure she can tell us.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_i've got a bad feeling about this.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_i've learned that sometimes the solution to your problems can come from where you least expect it.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_is it just me, or have we seen this crevice three times already?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_it all began many moons ago in canterlot.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_it took the vampire fruitbats' desire to be vampire fruitbats.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_it was said of snowfall that she was almost as studied as starswirl the bearded.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_it wasn't a stretch to think they wished themselves to the fair. It's all they were talking about.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_it's a good idea to stop, and listen to your friends opinions and perspectives.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_just let her go.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_last one.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_maybe this is the book princess celestia was talking about!

Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_my friends and I all learned an important lesson this week, never judge a book by its cover.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_not quite.

Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_rainbow dash, rarity, and fluttershy, let's save spike!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_remind me how this happened again?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_right. the point is, snowfall was also a powerful unicorn.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_she wanted to be perfect.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_she'll be a lot happier when i deliver the good news that she can go back to working at the library.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_silverstable community. for the best golden years.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_snowfall was all set to cast her spell that would erase hearth's warming eve for all time.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_so I used my magic to cut one out of a crystal block.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_so if i give her the book, she can get her old job back.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_so pinkie pie, are you sure that this friend of rainbow dash is really so mean?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_sorry darling, but i must decline the invitation To your soiree.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_sorry i can't make it, but i'm still a mite upset about everything that happened on the boat. applejack.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_sorry i can't make the tea party today, But there's a small problem with the guest list.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_sorry to interrupt your plein air painting.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_special magical connection with her friends, Maybe even before she's met them.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_spike and i were just trying to follow applejack's list as closely as possible.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_thank you, princess.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_thank you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_that you didn't notice Your friends were doing the same thing.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_the end.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_then all our problems.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_this is the story of a powerful unicorn named snowfall frost, who hated hearth's warming eve.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_this.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_time, spike?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_uh, girls?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_we didn't need to defeat them.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_we encourage acts of generosity and kindness.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_we got to work extra hard to make up for lost time.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_we just needed to face them long enough to distract you!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_we need to find items that are connected to the pillars in some way.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_well, that's it. thanks for letting me read you the story.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_well, the party was.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_what do you mean?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_what trouble?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_when a voice from the hearth caught her attention.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_which should be taken into consideration when we have a roundtable discussion.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_with the elements of harmony!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_with those, we can defeat anypony.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_without this, i don't know what we'd do.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_wow. i didn't realize applejack had so much to do.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_you two really should set aside some time.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral_Very Noisy_zecora was right. we're doomed.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__A Zebra.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__A bit more energy.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__A crystal fair.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__A friendship problem?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__A k yearling just might be my favorite author.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__A nature walk.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__A new position I created for you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__A powerful pony who wanted to rule Equestria.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__A prank isn't very good If you're the only pony laughing.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__A simple disagreement wouldn't change that.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__A stake out.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__A tri horned bunyip.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__About that, one thing i forgot to mention.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__About that.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__About what?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__According to ember's letters.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__According to this book, it was established by their first queen, and became their most important tradition.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Actually the bear's a changeling and he's quite gentle.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Actually, as ruler of Equestria, I'd like to postpone the coronation for a while.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Actually, i kind of have something else in mind.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Actually, it's not dyed.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Actually, not exactly.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Actually, not so much. flurry got into some mischief.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Actually, we're right in the middle of.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Actually, you've been asleep for three days.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Add that together, and what do you get?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__After we find your whammy, of course.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Ahem.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Ahem. the element of generosity and its importance in relation to the other elements of harmony.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__All I know is whatever comes next is going to be perfect.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__All of Equestria is at stake.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__All of those ponies look so posh.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__All of you had tough choices to make.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__All right, girls.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__All right, let's get to the bottom of this.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__All right, so you sat down at the table, and then what happened?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__All right, then.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__All right. Uh, cloud three.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__All we have to do is make both thorax and ember feel special And keep them apart for a few more hours.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Allright.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Always hoarding their bits and other treasures, But all that changed when king grover Found the mysterious golden idol of boreas.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__An ursa minor.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And I'm pretty sure Star Swirl won't mind.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And a number one assistant, right?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And always being there for everypony.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And be there for spike, of course.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And fluttershy too.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And go somewhere less, flammable?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And harmony has been maintained in Equestria for generations since.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And help them find it themselves.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And her stripes aren't a fashion choice rarity.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And i am pretty sure you've made enough.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And i couldn't predict the future either, so i only had one other choice.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And i have to hand it to you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And i learned this.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And i plan to keep that promise.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And i'm gonna make it on my own.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And i'm happy to report That all of ponyville has learned.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And i'm just the pony for the job.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And i'm sorry rainbow dash.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And i've never read a thing about any creature Other than a pony getting a cutie mark.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And if fluttershy no longer has to be a model, Rarity will no longer have to be jealous of her.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And if you come with me, i'll prove it.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And if you're interested, i think starlight has a place For you at my school after all.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And it must be a special one.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And it wasn't rampaging.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And it's up to us to fix it all.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And just when the last pony thought she was safe.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And make a list of my friends' names.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And maybe she's not lurking by the stores. Maybe she's going to them, lurk free, to do some shopping?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And more importantly, how does the castle look?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And read about you in my letters.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And share what she learned about friendship.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And since we're not even from here ourselves.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And so does my castle.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And so is making another pony's dreams come true.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And something that once he had, he didn't want to lose.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And tell her what you've learned?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And terrorized bushels of brand new bouncing baby bunnies.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And thanks to pinkie's connections organizing The ponypalooza rock concert.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And that's exactly what we'll show her.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And that's why i've asked you here.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And the knives, are sharp. always be careful with knives.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And then a bunch of you flip out for no good reason.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And then she decided to come back home on her own.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And three ponies were having a slumber party.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And together we think we've come up with a spell That will get it working again.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And undoing one group of friends made its magic less powerful.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And we were able to clear a shelf for Those old fashioned books you wanted to donate.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And we'll all help you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And we're sorry we couldn't see it sooner.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And we've always succeeded.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And whatever happens, we'll get through it together.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And where are applejack and fluttershy?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And why would she be giving a farewell performance?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And you and applejack did a great job collecting Those photos and putting them in the book.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And you're in charge of the food?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And your delivery was, great.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__And, what do you think, Spike?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Another pony named starlight glimmer used this map To travel through time and change things in the past.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Any other suggestions?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Any suggestions?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Anything i can do to make it easier on you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Anything?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Anytime i had a final exam with Celestia.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Apple bloom, would you mind writing to princess celestia And telling her what you learned?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Applejack's trying to make dresses!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Applejack, we need to talk.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Applejack, you're not a Failure.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Applejack, you're not a Failure.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Applejack.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Applejack.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Applejack?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Are those all the necklaces pinkie pie sent you?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Are you alright?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Are you ready?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Are you sure it was this table?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Are you sure that's what happened?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Are you sure?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Aren't there more animals that need cleaning?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__As long as I have my friends by my side, I'll put my faith in.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__As long as we do too, we'll be fine.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__As soon as i think of a new solution.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__As the princess of friendship.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__At least our retreat isn't too far behind schedule.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__At least until the castle's rebuilt.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Aw, come on spike. that wasn't too bad.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Beautiful indeed.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Because even when one friendship dies, The results can be disastrous.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Because i can tell that all of you are.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Because i knew what it was like when she and luna lived here.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Because i'm going to solve a friend's problem and get that letter to princess celestia before sundown!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Because with friendship as our armor and teamwork as our power.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Besides, there's something we need to do first.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Better. now i suppose you're all wondering Why i've gathered you all here today.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Bird's nests?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Blown across the mountains by the north winds.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Both the settlers and the buffalo Have good reasons to use this land.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Both! we've all been so busy teaching, we've hardly had a chance to hang out with each other.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But I think the three of you know what to wish for.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But I'm glad you could come.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But I'm not afraid.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But are you forgetting that the rings were scattered to the four corners of tenochtitlan?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But at least no big disasters happened.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But because they help make me who i am.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But everycreature here has reminded me of the true power of friendship!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But everything's fine now.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But i did get fifth place, which is rather good, considering i've never run a race before.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But i do have to set a good example, especially for magic students.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But i figured out how to get you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But i need a quick favor.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But i think applejack is right.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But i told her not to worry.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But i'd really rather do this on my own.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But i'm here if you ever need to talk.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But i'm picking the next activity you two lead.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But i'm sure you'd never let that get in the way of friendship education.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But i, just wanna be sure.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But i-i can't let you do that.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But if you want to share your time with others, that's fine.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But if you're the one doing the scaring, then.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But it all came from you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But it isn't the elements that will keep us connected.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But it shouldn't come to that.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But it was each of these ponies standing next to me Who taught me the lessons in those journals.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But it's not my place to judge. it's all up to you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But it's, purely research.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But maybe i'd better see if pinkie pie needs help with the pancakes!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But maybe you should try it a tiny bit louder.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But maybe.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But my hooves are tied.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But nothing my number one assistant can't handle.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But now it seems my top student has missed the most important lesson of all.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But others got used to living under the water and stayed in seaquestria.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But she wanted to spread the word Of the storm king's defeat.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But so are the rest of the wonderbolts.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But that's ok.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But then i was afraid it would have to be a going away present.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But there is a third way.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But there will always be more to do! Which is why we teach others about the Magic of Friendship!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But there's plenty we can't do either.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But this could be the most important thing We've ever done.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But we have to face facts.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But we'd like to show you even more.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But we've done this kind of thing before.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But what about after the coronation?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But when you made the right one, and embraced your element.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But where?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But will i ever?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But with some practice and some help from my friends, I got better. and now? i'm the princess of friendship.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But without friends, things can be a lot harder.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But you already know that, Which is why i'd like to give you these.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But you are my number one assistant.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But you do know something about rainbow dash.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But you gonna have to trust me.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But you shouldn't take your anger out on your friends.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But you're still gonna have to make amends.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But, meadowbrook lived ages ago and, Didn't she disappear?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__But.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__By stopping queen chrysalis Not only did they save equestria.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__By treating discord as a friend.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Call me silly, but i think this whole hero thing Might be going to rainbow dash's head.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Can i count on you?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Can we visit this cave?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Can't they help?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Carry the fifteen.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Celestia wants to experience the special friendship that theatre ponies have.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Cheerilee?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Cheese sandwich.

Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Come on, zecora.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Could you help me please?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Couldn't one of the royal guard have unfurled the banner?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Cross referenced by size and reverse indexed by fabric.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Curses, schmurses.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Dash, i'm sure whatever you did was an honest mistake.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Deal.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Dear Princess Celestia,.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Dear Princess Celestia.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Dear princess celestia.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Defeated by the elements of harmony and imprisoned in the moon.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Did you meet some nice ponies There?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Didn't quite catch that.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Do you have a ball i can borrow?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Do you know the name of the wonderbolts' premiere choreographer?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Do you still have a giant file of everypony's favorite treat?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Does it have something to do with this molt you were talking about?

Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I just came back from Ponyville urgent.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I just want the princess to approve of my friends.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I just want to make sure you're ready for this dinner.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I just wish there was another way we could convince them not to eat them in the first place.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I know Princess Celestia will want to read about what happened today.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I know everything about her.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I know he has more to offer the world as a pony, than a statue.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I know i've heard of those before.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I know it's hard, but sometimes you just can't do what you want.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I know she'll add a touch of elegance to the whole thing.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I know that, now.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I know this is hard for you pinkie.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I know we're up to the challenge of keeping Equestria safe and happy.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I know you all want to complete your jobs on time, but arguing is no way to go about it.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I know you can.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I know you feel a lot of pressure.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I know you're upset that i won't let you come to my school.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I know you've been competitive in the past.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I know, i'm not worried.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I know.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I know.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I know. But there's gonna be plenty of time for all the challenges and struggles and adventures to come.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I love to duck behind the paintings, and though the hall of hooves still Gives her a bit of a fright.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I may have offered some guidance, But you are responsible for the pony you've become.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I may not know what comes next for you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I mean, i did return the book, after all.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I mean, perhaps it's you pinkie, who needs to improve her attitude.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I mean, somepony here doesn't want us talking to sugar belle.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I mean, you're me, but i'm me too.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I met somepony tonight who was having the same problem.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I must say, i was impressed By that spell she used to fix the dam.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I only meant that for your benefit So you could get the most out of our time together.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I plan on giving it to her after the ceremony.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I promise.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I remember the first time I realized it might not last forever.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I said no magic. you were supposed to do it by hoof So i could work in a friendship lesson.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I see.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I shouldn't have agreed to watch her With such a jam packed schedule.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I still don't feel like i'm one hundred percent ready,.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I suppose you're right.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I suppose.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I sure can't practice here.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I take it you forgive me?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I think i can explain.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I think i'll just have a traditional massage, but you go for it.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I think our friendship is strong enough to handle anything the world can throw at us.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I think she's cured now, fluttershy.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I think she's right. it looks like we've got it spike.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I think the only way we're gonna catch her is if we find a way to lure her closer to us.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I think there's a copy in the library filed under Discontinued But Still Potentially Useful Ancient Texts.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I think we might want something A little more practical this time.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I think we're all a little nervous about maud's visit.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I think you're right.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I thought he came to ponyville to see you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I thought you'd never find one you liked.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I try to set an example for all of equestria.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I understand how hard this is for you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I understand why you want to look elsewhere.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I understand, but now you're both in trouble.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I want to bring the astronomical astronomers' almanac to all things astronomy.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I was hoping you'd say that. Because now that my crown's been fitted, we have some royal errands to run!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I was talking to fluttershy.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I wasn't a natural at friendship.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I went to get my secret weapon.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I wish princess celestia didn't need my help With the friendship summit in griffonstone.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I wish that starlight was here To see how strong friendships can be When we trust each other and work together!
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I wonder if there's anything in Shadetail Evergreen's Tome of Flora and Fauna?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I wonder what's gonna drop out of the sky this time.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I would love a daffodil and daisy sandwich.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I wouldn't sell yourself short.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__I'd love to make a special report to the princess.

Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__If i had i would've written about it in the journal.

Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Is that why you all have those cutie marks?
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__It could've happened to any of us.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__It doesn't mean that we don't think you're helpful.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__It doesn't seem that my new role as a princess equates to all that much.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__It must be awfully intimidating to meet all of us at once.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__It sure is.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__It was a big deal.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__It was a friendship lesson, not a baking lesson.

Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Luna created the tantabus to punish herself.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Maybe i can send her there.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Maybe if you took a friend along it might make things easier.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Maybe it is, just a little.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Maybe it's a little early for a group hug.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Maybe not.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Maybe she comes to town to visit.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Maybe she wouldn't like it done by color.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Maybe terramar is making it harder than it has to be.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Maybe there is.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Maybe this wasn't even on purpose.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Maybe we should all do the same.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Maybe we should just go and get her.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Maybe we should just postpone.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Maybe you could tell us how the war started.
Twilight_Sparkle_Neutral__Maybe you should just try being yourself.

Twilight_Sparkle_Sad_Very Noisy_Poor Spike.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad_Very Noisy_Really?
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad_Very Noisy_That party was everything to her. I can only imagine what it must've felt like when i didn't show up.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad_Very Noisy_That's all there is.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad_Very Noisy_The fight. i can't fight it anymore.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad_Very Noisy_The future. or rather, the present.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad_Very Noisy_Waste your time, worrying, about.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad_Very Noisy_We had so many wonderful memories here.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad_Very Noisy_Yep.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad_Very Noisy_You are not dumb.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad_Very Noisy_You're right. this party can't make up for the way i hurt you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__About a hundred times.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__Actually, I do have this book.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__All right then, just listen.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__And I'm sorry too, Spike.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__And all i seem to do is, smile and wave.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__And i can't forgive myself until i set things right.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__And i will do anything i can to make it up to you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__And maud, we're sorry that you felt the only way to spare pinkie pie's feelings was to leave ponyville early.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__And my own friends. i need to give you the same freedom.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__And now, because i didn't listen to her.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__And that i certainly wasn't one to the three of you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__And that's because i didn't know how important friendship was.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__And they mean more to me than anything.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__And your own friends.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__Are you kidding me?
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__Before i left canterlot, i didn't really appreciate my friends.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__But I didn't look inside because the title was so.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__But i hope you know how much i love you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__But i promised you could be in our play.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__But i've learned so much since i moved to ponyville.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__But instead i got carried away with plans and ruined everything.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__But instead, i just lost a brother.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__But not everything can be fixed with dresses And cupcakes.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__But please, don't let my mistake be the reason You can't be friends with anypony else.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__But seeing how my actions affected you, That was one of the worst feelings i've ever had.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__But will you please reconsider?
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__But, that's no excuse for what i said.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__Bye, I guess.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__C'mon spike.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__Come on out and talk to us.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__Do i want to know?
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__Do you think being raised by ponies Has affected you in other ways?
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__Except it was all a lie.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__I don't know.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__I failed.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__I have to leave them.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__I just lost a brother. i'm sorry.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__I just want us to stop fighting.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__I know what i did was wrong.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__I let everypony down.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__I never thought it would happen.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__I saw.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__I should have been more sensitive.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__I should've told you the truth.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__I wanted a fun trip with my friends.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__I wanted to be able to give something back to you.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__I was wrong, i'm sorry.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__I wish i had more dragonish knowledge to give you.

Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__If my friends don't care about the retreat i planned for them.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__If you want to forget it all and head home, i won't be offended.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__It's just that sometimes I need some help at night.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__Just like how i left my friendships.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__Just like me, you have to make your own decisions.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__Just once.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__Just when i learn how wonderful it is to have friends.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__Like i did.
Twilight_Sparkle_Sad__Looks like i'm the one who misjudged you.

Zecora_Annoyed_Noisy_I've run out of amethyst.
Zecora_Annoyed_Noisy_The only changeling attack i see, is the one that comes here looking for me!
Zecora_Annoyed_Noisy_Your thinking needs a readjust.
Zecora_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Even if what you are saying were true, We'd never surrender to a creature like you!
Zecora_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Ponies, what is this you.
Zecora_Annoyed__Total concentration is a must.
Zecora_Annoyed__have you gone mad?
Zecora_Anxious_Noisy_But it's not worth discussing right now we should go!
Zecora_Anxious_Noisy_But suddenly, i don't feel so well.
Zecora_Anxious_Noisy_But the both of us trapped in the same one's absurd!
Zecora_Anxious_Noisy_Honestly, it's hard to tell,
Zecora_Anxious_Noisy_No need to fret, i only got wet.
Zecora_Anxious_Noisy_No, no no! not at all.
Zecora_Anxious_Noisy_Oh, i wish you'd escaped either claw of this bird.
Zecora_Anxious_Noisy_Something, something ball?
Zecora_Anxious_Noisy_That's something that would have been quite nice to know.
Zecora_Anxious_Very Noisy_From my home, i had to flee.
Zecora_Anxious_Very Noisy_He is going to turn into a monster.
Zecora_Anxious_Very Noisy_If spike continues to collect, More growth will certainly occur.
Zecora_Anxious_Very Noisy_Race to the map while we hold off the attack, Stop starlight and put the whole world back on track!
Zecora_Anxious_Very Noisy_The forest has grown too wild, even for me.
Zecora_Anxious_Very Noisy_You can't hide in a tree, you have to come down!
Zecora_Anxious__Is there anything that can be done? For such a terrible conundrum?
Zecora_Anxious__No! No!
Zecora_Anxious__Tell me doctor, what should i do? I've never heard of swamp fever, mind you.
Zecora_Confused_Noisy_Why would you think to point your hooves at me?
Zecora_Happy_Noisy_And he'll give a mighty cock-a-doodle-doo!
Zecora_Happy_Noisy_Thank you fluttershy, for all you endured.
Zecora_Happy_Noisy_That's marvelous, fluttershy.
Zecora_Happy_Noisy_What a lovely hi, Miss pinkie pie.
Zecora_Happy_Noisy_Why, it's apple bloom, my dear.
Zecora_Happy__You are always welcome, my little filly.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_A cutie pox cure i have forsooth.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_A dash will ignite the rooster's fire.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_A perfect question, my little friend.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_About all this bad mojo that's floating around you.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Ah, time is a river, where even the tiniest Changes seen, can lead to a cascade of events, downstream.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Ah, you've gone and chipped your tooth.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_And cured everything from hoof cough to fur blight.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_And it is these friends you have in life.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Another sip of the potion will give you a peek.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_As i mentioned before, there's no easy fix.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_At last, rarity i've searched for so long.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_At least now i can easily grab All the crisscross moss there is to be had.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Aye, me. but what is this?
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Because on this journey, you've learned a great deal.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Beneath this salve, no changeling hides.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Beware! beware, you pony folk!
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Beware! beware, you pony folk!
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_But before i can do my duty.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_But doors are barred and shutters shut.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_But i'm glad, that the last was a new pair of wings!
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_But my methods are mine. After all, i've been doing this for quite a long time.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_But none for what you want, dear apple bloom.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_But one must be patient for all things good.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_But tell me, how all this came to pass.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_But the answer you need may still be out of reach.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_But, as for the molt smell, let's not take any chances.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_But, i may have something that if combined with a spell.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Can't treat your symptoms down there on the ground It's safe to come out, there's no ponies around.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Cleaning is simple, but a magical fix.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Come with me.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Come, little pip. now, don't you fret.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Could cause any number of troublesome tics.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Every year, we put on a disguise.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Follow me, and very soon you'll hear the tale Of nightmare moon.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_For it is we, who should not be.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_For it reveals the truth inside.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_For nightmare moon you must not offend.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_For your cutie mark, you will have to wait.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_For your mane, of course, just soap will do, So use my super sudsy shampoo.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Guess i should have stayed inside my hut.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_He is starting to mature. of this fact, i am quite sure.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_I am brewing up another mix For a rooster and his chicks.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_I am quite impressed, While you're gone on your journey I'll try not to be, worried.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_I can cure this pony that is hoarse. but it will take a longer course.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_I can mix a brew that will work just right. but it cannot heal him by tonight.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_I do not dare to use it myself.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_I doubt that your mane has left us forever, There's a chance we can fix it i think, if we're clever.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_I have just the trick that will fix you up quite quick.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_I know that the molt produced surprising things.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_I know where it grows so it's not much to ask, Though retrieving it has been a difficult task.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_I must go get this purple flower For my brew to have full power.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_I need to focus if i'm to work any faster, One wrong ingredient spells utter disaster.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_I thought i had removed their fear The last time that i visited here.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_I thought i'd picked enough to fix All the potions i had to mix.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_I'll show you the way to make sure she won't stay.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_I'll tell you where you got your fears.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_I'm afraid i can't fix it before the big shoot, But in time the hair will grow back from the root.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_I'm going to need some of your booty.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_I'm sorry my dear, but there's nothing to say.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_If not for you, i would not be cured.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_If the goal is to not have your friends all depart, perhaps your volume is where we should start.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_If they are changelings we'll soon see.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_If you focus on that which you want to remove.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_If you train with me so good you'll be.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_If you will remember back.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Is that you rarity?
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_It is one we call heart's desire.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_It was a special flower that i needed found.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_It's a magic ailment i've treated for years.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_It's a popular potion, for all creatures this year.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_It's a simple cure, and the directions are clear just, one or two drops in each of your ears.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Making mornings very slow.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Manes are tricky i have learned.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_My zebra sense did not bring me round.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Mystical and masked, she came in the night.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Nightmare night's not over yet.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Now, drink down every little drop, And this mixture will mend that chip on top.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Of nightmare night so dark and scary.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Or the story of the infinitely splitting end.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Perhaps further back still, are the answers you seek.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Perhaps it'd be better if i were more clear.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Perhaps we can lessen this strange molt effect.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Princess twilight, you can turn the potion from purple to white.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Rarity's gone. there's no need to hide.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Regret is not what you should feel.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Remember when you pony folk, stumbled into poison joke?
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_That keep equestria free from strife?
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_The ailments you have aren't something to cure The molt's a condition that dragons endure.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_The changelings took over not long ago.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_The cream that you want is just over here.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_The perfect temperature for ponies, I presume. Now, where is that little apple bloom?
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_The result would be tragic. it only responds to alicorn magic.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_The smell is the most likely cause i suspect.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_The words I chanted were from olden times. Something you call a nursery rhyme.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_The words I spoke were quite exact.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_There are many mixtures in this room.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_There are tales i could tell, to make your hair stand on end, Horrifying, terrifying, attempts to mane mend.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_There we go. now, that wasn't so tough.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_There's a healer of legend who never would fail, But i only know her from ancient folk tales.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_There's so many accounts of her power to heal, She can't just be a legend, i think she's real.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_There's the contagious frizz that spreads friend to friend.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_These seeds must be planted in the ground. With the truth, they'll grow, and the cure is found.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_This part of the forest is dark and damp.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Those friends as you know them are not here, alas.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Those leaves of blue are not a joke.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Though i wonder if we should continue outside.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Though i'll wager in your world that isn't so.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_We must fix that tooth before it's too late.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_We still have candy left to give So nightmare moon might let us live.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Well, who is it that we have here?
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_What became of the healer, nopony knows, For she disappeared ages and ages ago.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_What has happened to you, youth?
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_What i told you before was totally wrong.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_When it comes to magic.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_With each mistake, you learn something new, Growing up into a better you.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_With heart's desire, his talent comes into view.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_With just a few drops, any mess you'll improve.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_You can't clean up sugarcube corner from here.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_You just took the wrong potion from here yesterday.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_You must prevent him from practicing greed.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_You should go finish your list of to dos. Keep your mind off all of these mane losing blues.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_You think jewels are what you need, But there's no worse mojo than dragon greed.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_You were right to be concerned.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Your frustration is well understood.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Your tale of woe upsets me so.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_Zecora can take the bad away if you do just what i say.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_for a cutie mark, Time is the only remedy.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_here is the book, you see?
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_i'm sure they seem strange.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_tales of crops and harvests consumed.
Zecora_Neutral_Noisy_to gobble up ponies in one quick swing!
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_A dragon's heart is prone to greed.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_A steady diet to make growth speed.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_Ah, a friendship with discord is truly a shock.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_All right, this potion will break the spell.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_Apple bloom, what do you say.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_Beware! Beware!
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_But after my visit from apple bloom, Some had mysteriously left my room.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_But if i am to be honest, it's just for show.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_But it's done well to hide our camp.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_But nightmare moon wants just one thing.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_But who says it is something that we must block?
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_Did this flower just walk away?
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_Fill up her belly with a treat or two.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_For healing power is in the seeds of truth.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_Hungrily she soars the sky.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_I'm afraid it is a mystery as well.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_If she sees no pony, she passes by.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_If this trait should go unchecked.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_In what way can you tell, that they are indeed under a spell?
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_It is unwise to venture down this road.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_It seems the rooster has lost his crow,.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_It ties the room together and emits a warm glow.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_It would be tragic if somepony licked me, especially trixie.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_Listen close, my little dears.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_Must interfere with your focus.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_Only makes their hunger rise.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_Only then can victory be earned.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_So if she comes and all is clear.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_So she won't return to come eat you!
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_The seeds of truth do hold the cure, But one must speak words, true, and pure.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_Then the resulting bigger size.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_Then you will be able to tell.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_To save ourselves from her searching eyes.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_Unlearn what you have learned.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_You may see why the sky is day, and night.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_Zecora knows just what to do.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_if his monstrous ways You wish to impede.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_if these creatures are in ponyville.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_no noise, no sound, no din, no fuss.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_of nightmare moon who makes you wary.
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_oh, monster of so little size. is that a parasprite before my eyes?
Zecora_Neutral_Very Noisy_you're doomed.
Zecora_Neutral__A magic potion does not hold the key.
Zecora_Neutral__After a sip, you may see why the sky is day, and night.
Zecora_Neutral__Ah, the feathers of that bird can affect pony's ears.
Zecora_Neutral__Are you talking about teaching asparagus to sing?
Zecora_Neutral__But it seems that i'm ready to help you with yours.
Zecora_Neutral__Chrysalis and her army will soon draw near!
Zecora_Neutral__Fluttershy tell me, will this be enough?
Zecora_Neutral__Fluttershy, you are not to blame.
Zecora_Neutral__Hmmm.
Zecora_Neutral__I don't understand.
Zecora_Neutral__I have many a healing brew.
Zecora_Neutral__I have volume concerns today by the scores.
Zecora_Neutral__I know you are speaking but i can't hear a thing.
Zecora_Neutral__I'm sure you can, but let's not talk here.
Zecora_Neutral__If trixie's tricks have you in a fix.
Zecora_Neutral__Instead, this plant just wants a laugh.
Zecora_Neutral__It means this plant does not breed wrath.
Zecora_Neutral__Mane mending magic's the trickiest of tricks.
Zecora_Neutral__Maybe next time you will take a second look. And not judge the cover of the book.
Zecora_Neutral__Miss fluttershy had an unusual change, deepening her vocal range.
Zecora_Neutral__Mix it up, I certainly will.
Zecora_Neutral__No wonder you're dour, it's an abuse of power.
Zecora_Neutral__No, this lack of hair was put into motion, When you mistakenly washed with remover potion.
Zecora_Neutral__Now, apple bloom. do not be silly.
Zecora_Neutral__Of an earth pony who needed to clean up her shop.
Zecora_Neutral__Of course.
Zecora_Neutral__Oh, i do feel fine, and this honey is divine.
Zecora_Neutral__Please, forgive my strange elation, but i was not laughing at your situation.
Zecora_Neutral__Sad that you lack it in your library.
Zecora_Neutral__That plant is much like poison oak.
Zecora_Neutral__The meaning is far worse i see.
Zecora_Neutral__There is much, much that i can teach.
Zecora_Neutral__There is one story i nearly forgot.
Zecora_Neutral__There's no magical cure to hasten us through it.
Zecora_Neutral__These things happen, all the same.
Zecora_Neutral__This one speaks, hello. And this, welcome.
Zecora_Neutral__Those leaves of blue are not a joke.
Zecora_Neutral__Though i think they're not what they appear to be.
Zecora_Neutral__Treasures of the native land where I am from.
Zecora_Neutral__Twilight sparkle, much work have you done.
Zecora_Neutral__Unless you went backward it time to undo it.
Zecora_Neutral__When it comes to break outs, i've seen all circumstances.
Zecora_Neutral__With these leaves i can mix a brew creating the same effect, on you.
Zecora_Neutral__Yes, little one. it is true.
Zecora_Neutral__Yet I am missing an herb from ponyville.
Zecora_Neutral__You can turn the potion from purple to white.
Zecora_Neutral__You learned all of my lessons, all but one.
Zecora_Neutral__You must mix your magic and use the six.
Zecora_Neutral__uh.
Zecora_Shouting_Noisy_We stand a much better chance on the ground!
Zecora_Shouting_Very Noisy_Equestria is safe another year!
Zecora_Shouting_Very Noisy_Stop!
Zephyr_Amused_Noisy_Dad, please, when i get all my stuff back in here, you won't Even remember what this boring old place looked like.

Zephyr_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Guess the only breeze this zephyr can count on, is his own.
Zephyr_Annoyed_Very Noisy_Ugh! i can't do this. i can't do anything.
Zephyr_Annoyed__She expects me to do stuff, right when she asks me to do it!
Zephyr_Annoyed__Ugh! what's a pony gotta do to find a decent stick around here?
Zephyr_Anxious_Noisy_Um, i don't know.

Zesty Gourmand_Annoyed_Noisy_Her friend can tell you how to maintain a tragic look For a frizzy mane.
Zesty Gourmand_Annoyed_Noisy_It is not in keeping with the level of cuisine That i have set for canterlot.
Zesty Gourmand_Annoyed_Noisy_and i would think Even you could recognize that the decor here Is trying desperately, while desperately failing.
Zesty Gourmand_Annoyed_Very Noisy_I think we are done here.
Zesty Gourmand_Annoyed__Nopony told you this place was acceptable.
Zesty Gourmand_Annoyed__Substandard food, laughable service.
Zesty Gourmand_Annoyed__They can't tell you what food you can eat.
Zesty Gourmand_Annoyed__They told you? and who are they to tell you anything?
Zesty Gourmand_Annoyed__What is everypony doing here? this place has no hooves.
Zesty Gourmand_Neutral__But take some advice from a friend.
Zesty Gourmand_Neutral__Keep your opinions out of restaurants.
Zesty Gourmand_Neutral__Rarity can tell you what hats to wear with which skirts.
Zesty Gourmand_Neutral__Rarity, when it comes to fashion, you are adequate.
Zesty Gourmand_Neutral__Recommending a disreputable place such as this, Could do serious damage to your social standing.
Zesty Gourmand_Neutral__The barest hint of a sensation.
Zesty Gourmand_Smug_Noisy_I hardly think it matters. But by all means, try your best to impress.
Zesty Gourmand_Smug_Very Noisy_That's what i bring to canterlot. that's art.
Zesty Gourmand_Smug__And create an obvious taste, that uncultured ponies Like those two can register.
Zesty Gourmand_Smug__Anypony can throw ingredients together.
Zesty Gourmand_Smug__But it takes a true culinary artist To create, a subtle taste.
