I started writing this story on 02/04/2020.
<br />
<br />I got inspired by this album of music here, it is very good:
<br />Soundtrack: Sharks - Maelstrom EP (<a class="text_white" href="https://soundcloud.com/sharkstunes/sets/maelstrom-ep-rushdown-release" target="_blank">link here</a>).
<br />(<a class="text_white" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wglf-7EkU" target="_blank">YouTube link</a>).
<br />Songs: Out My Head, Amethyst, Maelstrom, Mermaid, Coral
<br />
<br />I got inspired by the album above, and a guy wrote a comment on the SoundCloud page of the song called <a class="text_white" href="https://soundcloud.com/rushdownrecs/sharks-coral?in=sharkstunes/sets/maelstrom-ep-rushdown-release" target="_blank">Coral</a> of the album.
<br />His username is TimeShocked, URL is vinod-mahadik-806863844, he commented at 0:44 of the song.
<br />This is his comment:
<br />To conclude the EP, I made a story that summarizes the EP. There was a girl named Anna who has met a classmate that can read her mind and Anna seems to never notice it. After a few days, Anna got suspicious of her classmate having one "?". "How can she read my mind?". She decided to confront her and tell her to get "OUT MY HEAD". After she did that, her classmate stopped reading her mind. But they were still friends. After that they went to the beach after a few hours, Anna saw an "AMETHYST" glowing at the shallow shore. Anna went to get it and it was hard to get it off the ground. After getting it off the ground, Anna noticed that she was getting sucked in the ocean, but it was not the ocean, It was a "MAELSTROM"! After getting sucked in Anna was shocked by the fact that she can breathe underwater and was admiring the magical reefs of the oceans glowing. After some time she encountered a "MERMAID" that looked nice and gave her shelter. After that, she lived in the "CORAL" reefs forever.
<br />
<br />I liked that comment a lot, it was a good story, even if it was small.
<br />Then I got inspired to write something, so I started to write this story.
<br />I changed the character name from Anna to Ana, and in the middle of writing it, I changed the character name to my current girlfriend's name at the time.
<br />I always imagined Ana as Lapis Lazuli from the cartoon Steven Universe in her debut or first form, not the mean or nice one.
<br />She is Lapis Lazuli, the left one from the story cover.

<br />
<br />Also, a character that appears in this story, is a little inspired by Maui from the Disney movie called Moana.
<br />The fact that he can turn into a humanoid bird and a hawk-like bird.
<br />And there's also an inspiration from the space exploration game called No Man's Sky, I love that game, and I would love to explore space with a spaceship.
<br />
<br />I wrote this story for some time, well, one year, from 2020 to now, and did not post it, I kept writing it.
<br />And I think that I want to start posting it, so I am writing this introduction here, I am writing on 12/07/2021.
<br />I am also slicing up this story into chapters, the source of it is a big text file with 1.157 lines and two hundred thousand words.
<br />Well, let's get to the story, shall we?
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />There was a girl named Ana, she was soaring high in the sky, it was in the afternoon.
<br />She was thinking about some bad things about death and tragedy because she was close to the Clouds of Madness.
<br />It made people think bad things, that was the bad effect of being there.
<br />Some said that the wars and fights between people were caused by the storms that those clouds brought.
<br />Suddenly, her necklace broke and she fell on the beach of an island that was close there.
<br />The fall was too high and she got hurt, was knocked unconscious, and slept on the cold sand.
<br />
<br />She woke up and looked forward, her face was covered in sand and she cleaned it, her beautiful blue wings of fairy did not work anymore, she flapped them and little to no glitter came off them.
<br />Ana was out of magic power because her necklace broke, she needed to find something in the forest to fix it and needed to cure herself too, she was hurt and bleeding a little.
<br />She started walking in the forest, it was still afternoon, she grabbed some vines in the trees and tied up them in her bruise which was hurting.
<br />
<br />Then grabbed some more vines and started to make a little rope with them, she removed the rope of the necklace and pocketed the pink jewel.
<br />Ana made a thread with the vines and picked some tree resin from the pine trees that were close to there.
<br />She found charcoal from a bonfire that had gone out and made it into charcoal powder.
<br />Then made she prepared a campfire and left it burning, picked up some mud, and made two pots with it.
<br />She found a metal filter left in there, grabbed it, and melted the resin she got from the trees with the help of the mud pot, then filtered the impurities from the resin into another jar.
<br />Ana added the charcoal powder into the mix and stirred it up, she just finished making a natural glue with tree resin.
<br />She melted it again because it was already dry and fixed her jewel which was broken in half, it began shining with a blue light.
<br />The wings of Ana appeared again on her back, glowing a lot in blue and releasing glitter, she flapped them a little, her pink jewel shining in the same color.
<br />
<br />Ana started flying normally and decided to leave that island, she continued flying to where she was going before she lost her wings.
<br />She was a fairy, that lived in the Crystal Lands, she left home because she thought that she did not belong there and because she was afraid.
<br />Ana was flying as the wind blew her face, she was crying a little because she missed her home, she thought about her friends and family there.
<br />Then, a bird-like creature began flying beside her, it asked where she was going, she said that she was just traveling and flying through the world.
<br />The creature said its name was Tod, he was a Kódek, a creature that is like a bird, a hawk, and lives in the Mountains of Aris, close to the Volcanoes of Death island.
<br />Tod said that it was dangerous there because it was close to the Volcanoes of Death, some times one of the volcanoes erupted and lava invaded their houses.
<br />She said she missed home, Tod said he missed his too, he said he was going to travel back home, to see his family, and advised Ana to do the same.
<br />Ana replied to Tod, wishing him good luck, wanting him to be safe, Tod wished good luck for Ana too.
<br />
<br />After some time flying, it was night already, and it was raining everywhere, but Ana kept flying even if it was a little cold.
<br />Maelstroms formed in the ocean and you could see little islands from far away.
<br />Ana liked to see dark clouds and a huge and strong storm like that, she liked hearing the sounds of the thunders.
<br />She did not have a map in her hands, but she knew where home was, her necklace with a pink jewel showed her the way, made her feel where home is, it was given by her mother.
<br />It was a great gift, it made her think of the memories she had with her mother, it made her happy.
<br />Ana was flying and flying, in the direction that she felt that Crystal Lands was, trying to return home.
<br />
<br />...
<br />
<br />After a little while, she arrived there, it was a crystal island with a lot of crystals in its ground, growing from inside the ground, the friends and sisters of Ana were there to greet her.
<br />No fairy knew about how the crystals appeared there or their origin, Ana was curious about that, she wanted to discover the secret of the crystals.
<br />Everyone was worried about her because she disappeared out of nowhere, Ana arrived there soaked in water.
<br />Her sisters, Lindsay, and Panda asked why she left home, she replied that it was because she did not feel like she belonged there and because she was afraid.
<br />Lindsay was a redhead with yellow wings and red eyes, she was very kind and the older sister of Ana, she had twenty.
<br />She told her to not worry about it, as fairies are always kind, they will not do anything that other fairies do not want.
<br />Panda told her to not worry about that, they would protect her and always care for her, that she belonged there, Panda had eighteen.
<br />Her sisters said that she could travel to other places if she wanted, she could even live in those places.
<br />She was free and did not need to stay there if she did not want to.
<br />But she was always welcome there, and they would receive her with open arms.
<br />
<br />Ana walked through the Crystal Lands and arrived at the hut of her mother.
<br />Lindsay and Panda walked with her, her mother was there, she was called Jena, and had thirty-nine.
<br />She had nineteen when she had Lindsay, twenty when she had Ana, and twenty-one when she had Panda.
<br />Jena was worried about Ana because she disappeared without saying why.
<br />Jena was eating at the table of the kitchen, in the wooden made hut.
<br />The sisters of Ana started to eat at the table too, they were eating bread and milk.
<br />Ana apologized for leaving the island without telling why, she hugged her mother and Jena said it was okay.
<br />Ana said she was going to her room to rest a bit, she walked there and closed the door.
<br />The fairy thought about the crystals, about their secrets, and where they came from.
<br />She thought about where she could learn about their origin and their history.
<br />Ana was thinking about the land of the Stone Ogres, the land of the Soul Wasps, the ones that knew how to remove their soul from their body.
<br />Their body was a soul, they did not have a physical body, Ana thought that they could know something since they lived for so many years.
<br />The Soul Wasps lived in the Jar of Petals, an island close to the Volcanoes of Death, it haves sand, dirt, and tall mountains, it also has some crystals.
<br />The Stone Ogres lived in Tartanium Mocks, with a lot of rocks, trees, and also tall mountains.
<br />
<br />The birds were singing, making their noises, the water was hitting the shore, a tropical atmosphere with beautiful and relaxing sounds, perfect to sleep.
<br />Ana had a tough day, flying, crying, and having her necklace broken, she needed some rest, she was not used to being at home, she was used to sleeping in beds made of wood and mud.
<br />She is used to living in nature with wooden beds and natural things, campfires, fruits, and meat that she hunts and cooks.
<br />It was weird to be laid down on a comfortable bed with a mattress and a pillow.
<br />She slept for some time while listening to the birds, toucans, and the water hitting the shore, it was so relaxing.
<br />
<br />After some hours, she woke up, and it was afternoon, Jena left the house for a while to gather some food and fruits.
<br />The fairies lived in peace there, collecting and growing their food and making their furniture.
<br />Lindsay and Panda were playing some ball out there in the village while flying.
<br />Ana wanted to travel a little more, she wanted to be alone on a desert island, do nature things again.
<br />Ana left the house of her mother and told Lindsay and Panda that she was going to travel far again.
<br />Lindsay and Panda said okay and said that they were going to tell her mother, they hugged Ana tight.
<br />"We gonna miss you, Ana, I love you," said Lindsay, hugging Ana tight.
<br />"Me too Ana, I love you," said Panda.
<br />"I love you both," said Ana, almost crying, she gave a kiss on the cheek of both of them.
<br />Lindsay told Jena that maybe Ana was going to the Mountains of Aris.
<br />
<br />She left flying, Ana thought about that bird, Tod, the Kódek, she wanted to see him again, she wonders if he came back home and arrived safely there.
<br />Ana knew a lot of islands and places to go, in this world, this planet that she lived in, she is used to traveling a lot and knows the world a lot.
<br />The fairy had a map of the world inside her mind, she knew the Clouds of Madness, Crystal Lands, Mountains of Aris, and the Volcanoes of Death.
<br />She thinks Tod spoke a little about the Mountains of Aris, close to the Volcanoes of Death, she wanted to go there to visit him.

Ana was still flying, she arrived close to the Mountains of Aris, it was an island with lots of crystals of various colors that came from inside the ground.
<br />They were very beautiful, there were red, blue, cyan, pink, orange, yellow, white, black, and green crystals.
<br />They were shiny and pointy, Ana liked the sight of them, she wanted to get close to feel the crystals with her hand.
<br />She flew more and landed at the sand, a Kódek greeted her, asking who she was.
<br />"I am the friend of a Kódek called Tod, do you know him?" asked Ana.
<br />"Ah, Tod, yes, I think he went to an island to the north, he never stays home, sometimes I get worried about him.
<br />Sometimes I think he is gonna get into danger," said the Kódek.
<br />"Oh, thanks, I'm gonna go there to talk with him, to check if he's alright, okay?" said Ana.
<br />"Okay, thank you, my dear, what is your name?" asked the Kódek.
<br />"My name is Ana, what is yours?" asked Ana.
<br />"My name's Sophia, I am the mother of Tod..." said the Kódek.
<br />"Oh, I'll make sure he is safe Sophia! Don't worry, I'll bring your son home," said Ana, excited and brave, closing her fist.
<br />"Thank you so much, my dear, I'm so happy right now," said Sophia, she flew and hugged Ana, Ana hugged her back.
<br />Then Ana waved goodbye to Sophia and started flying to the island to the north.
<br />
<br />She was flying high in the sky, it started raining, she was with her pink necklace.
<br />Ana was catching the rain, it was a little cold, "I might catch a cold here," thought her.
<br />So she held her necklace and created a bubble of fire around her, protecting her from the cold rain.
<br />Her mother has taught her how to use the magic of the necklace, it was very powerful and had a lot of spells.
<br />Ana continued flying to the island of the north, searching for Tod.
<br />She thought about the mystery of the crystals, what was their origin story, how they appeared in that land.
<br />Suddenly, the rain stopped, a beautiful rainbow appeared in the sky, and the sun appeared again.
<br />Ana looked at that and thought that it was very beautiful and had a wonderful view.
<br />She continued flying with her blue wings, searching for the island of the north.
<br />
<br />Ana saw an island there, with palm trees, a forest, and sand around the island, it was morning.
<br />She thought that it was that island, so she flew close to it and landed on the sand.
<br />Ana walked around the island looking for Tod, looking at the trees, the sand, the dirt.
<br />The fairy found a humanoid bird there, a bird with the shape of a human, she looked at it with curiosity.
<br />"Hello... Who are you?..." asked Ana, looking at the creature.
<br />"Hey... I'm a Kódek, I guess you never saw a Kódek like this right?" asked the Kódek, looking at Ana.
<br />"Yeah... I never saw one like this, can I ask your name?" asked Ana.
<br />"Yes... My name is Tod, I'm sorry for making you see me like this... I'm ugly right?" asked Tod, feeling bad for showing that side of him to Ana.
<br />"No, you're beautiful Tod, I don't think you're ugly! You're even cooler than before!" replied Ana, looking at Tod.
<br />"Really?... Thanks, Ana, that means a lot to me, it is that the Kódeks don't show their humanoid form to everyone...
<br />That is a secret among us Kódeks and no one knows about that, so please, don't tell anyone that you saw this, okay?" asked Tod.
<br />"I won't tell anyone, I promise... So... How do you turn into a human or a humanoid bird?" asked Ana.
<br />"I have human blood, all Kódeks have, the story is that long ago, an evil race ruled the planet.
<br />They cursed us, and turned us into birds, we were humans before.
<br />Then, a great magician helped us, he cured us, and we could turn into humans again.
<br />But we didn't accept that, we got used to being birds, and this secret of us having human blood was hidden.
<br />So I always go to islands where there's no one, so I can turn into a humanoid bird and be myself because this is how I feel I am.
<br />I can even turn into a human," says Tod, transforming himself into a human, "See?"
<br />"That is awesome Tod! I wish I could turn into a bird, a cool bird like you, and your humanoid bird form is cool too.
<br />I'm sorry you can't turn into a humanoid bird or a human in front of others... But you turned into that in front of me.
<br />And you didn't run or try to hide when you saw me coming... Why?" asked Ana.
<br />"Because I thought you would understand... I thought you wouldn't have a bias with me... And you wouldn't judge me by my appearance," replied Tod.
<br />"Oh, I feel happy knowing you think that of me, of course, I would never judge you by your appearance..." said Ana.
<br />"Hehe, I feel happy having a friend like you Ana," said Tod, smiling at Ana.
<br />"Really? We're friends?" asked Ana, surprised, smiling a little.
<br />"Of course we're friends silly," said Tod, smiling at Ana, he walked close to her in his human form, hugging her.
<br />Ana accepted the hug and smiled, "Thanks Tod, you're a great friend," said her.
<br />(This is how the humanoid version of Tod looks like.)

<br />(The hawk at the right of the No Man's Sky Atlas Plumbob on the story cover is the bird version of Tod.)
<br />
<br />"So... What you're doing here on this island Tod?" asked Ana.
<br />"I'm just building nature stuff, building houses, campfires, hunting, and stuff, I love to do nature crafts," said Tod.
<br />"Really? I love to do that too, it is a great passion for me, we should do it together sometime!" said Ana, excited, smiling at Tod.
<br />"Of course, surviving is always more fun with a friend," said Tod, smiling.
<br />So Ana walked around the island, looking at the trees and the sand.
<br />"Did you build something here already?" asked Ana, looking at Tod in his human form.
<br />"No, I just arrived here, it's been some minutes, I was thinking about what to build first, and then you arrived, hehe," said Tod smiling.
<br />"Hehe, should we do an ax?" asked Ana, looking at him.
<br />"That sounds great!" said Tod.
<br />Then they looked for a good tree to make an ax handle, they found a small stone that looked like a knife.
<br />Tod grabbed that stone and got a thick tree branch.
<br />He grabbed a big stone and walked close to the water, he soaked the stone with water and walked close to the forest, sitting there.
<br />Ana followed him, looking at what he made, Tod started carving the small stone to make it sharper, like a knife.
<br />Then he walked close to a good tree and started cutting it with the help of the knife and the thick tree branch.
<br />After that, Ana and he grabbed the log together and walked close to the exit of the forest, leaving the log there.
<br />Ana grabbed the knife and the thick tree branch, cutting the log in half.
<br />She started making a hole in the half log to put a sharp stone inside it, then she gave the knife and tree branch to Tod.
<br />Tod made the same as Ana, making a hole in the other half log to put a sharp stone inside it.
<br />
<br />They both walked to the forest to search for large stones, rectangular stones.
<br />The two found two rectangular stones and brought them to the place where the half logs were.
<br />Ana started carving the rectangular stone with the big wet stone, shaping it to look like an ax blade.
<br />Then she left the wet stone there, grabbed her ax handle and her ax blade, and waited for Tod to finish his blade.
<br />Tod grabbed the rectangular stone he got and carved it using the wet stone.
<br />Ana looked at him, and the things they already made together, she was happy to survive with him, it was cool to do nature things with someone else.
<br />Then Tod and Ana grabbed her parts of their ax.
<br />They both grabbed the thick tree branch and started putting the ax blade made of stone inside the hole in the ax handle.
<br />After some minutes, they both finished making two axes with sharp stones as the blades.
<br />They were happy and shouted excitedly.
<br />The two grabbed apples to eat, they ate them and smiled at each other.
<br />"What about we make a campfire and some mud jars?" asked Ana.
<br />"I think that's a great idea, Ana," replied Tod.
<br />Then Ana looked for a big stone in the forest, she found it and brought it close to where Tod was.
<br />There was a small river in the forest, it had flowing water and mud.
<br />Ana and Tod walked to that river, they started grabbing some mud and bringing it close to the big stone.
<br />Ana made one jar of mud and Tod too, they started cutting trees and getting tree branches to make a fire.
<br />
<br />They also grab some dry leaves to use as a wick, they sit on the ground together and arrange the sticks, branches, and leaves like a campfire.
<br />The two cut three holes in a stick and put it on top of the dry leaves.
<br />Then Ana puts one stick on one of the holes of the other stick, turning it against the other until smoke comes out of the dry leaves.
<br />After the smoke appears, Ana removes the two sticks from the top of the leaves and picks them up with her hands, blowing them gently to make a fire.
<br />Then, after the fire appears, Ana leaves the dry leaves on top of the sticks and branches arranged like a campfire.
<br />They keep adding dry branches and sticks to the fire to fuel it.
<br />Then Tod gets the big dry stone and places it close to the fire, he gets the two jars of mud and places them on top of the stone for them to dry.
<br />The jars dry and Ana gets them, she fills both of them with water from the ocean.
<br />"Hey, should we do a furnace in here?" asks Tod.
<br />"Yes, that way we can cook food on top of it, and boil water too, we can't drink water from the ocean, we have to boil it," said Ana.
<br />Then Tod started getting some mud from the small river that was inside the forest.
<br />He brought the mud close to the campfire and started making bricks with it, leaving them close to the fire to dry.
<br />Then, with the help of Ana, Tod manages to make a furnace in the fire.
<br />They can fuel the fire from below, and the fire comes out from the top.
<br />Ana makes a mud lid for the jar, she puts it on top of the furnace for it to dry.
<br />After some minutes, Tod gets one jar of water and puts the lid on top of it, then he leaves the jar on top of the furnace.
<br />The water starts to boil, Ana and Tod waited for a while, they grabbed two thick tree branches and carefully removed the hot jar from the top of the furnace.
<br />
<br />The two waited for the water to get chill, Ana made a mud cup for her and Tod too, they left the cups on top of the furnace for them to dry.
<br />Then, they grabbed the chill water from the jar, and poured it into their cups, sat in the sand, drinking it while looking at each other.
<br />Ana and Tod looked at everything they built together, the jars, the campfire, the axes, they were so happy.
<br />"I never knew you liked to do nature things, it is very interesting... This interest that you have, hehe," said Tod smiling.
<br />"Hehe, I never knew you liked to do nature crafts too, it is a very good thing, relaxing.
<br />It makes you forget about the problems and stop thinking about them, that's why I like it.
<br />I feel like I am at home here, it is what I love to do," says Ana, smiling at Tod.
<br />"Look at everything we made together, hehe, I'm so proud of it!" said Tod, looking at the axes, the campfire, and the jars.
<br />"Me too! It is fun surviving together, I never shared this interest with anyone, it is good to have someone to share it," said Ana.
<br />"I agree with you, it is very good to share it, sometimes I feel so lonely surviving alone... I wish I could have someone there with me.
<br />And look at what I have now... You! Hehe, thanks Ana," said Tod, smiling at Ana.
<br />"No problem, hehe, I always appreciate some good company," said Ana.
<br />"So... What should we do now?" asked Tod.
<br />"Can we fish something?" asked Ana.
<br />"Yea, I think that's a great idea!" said Tod.
<br />"We have to make a spear first," said Ana.
<br />"Yes, let's make it then," said Tod, who started looking for a good thin tree to cut, he found one and cut it down.
<br />Tod then walked close to the fire and inserted the tip of the spear into the fire to char the blunt tip.
<br />After that, he grabbed the spear with its tip on fire and scraped it in a rock to sharpen it.
<br />Then he sat on the ground and grabbed a piece of wood, Tod polished the tip of the spear with it.
<br />"So, who should go first?" asked Tod, looking at Ana.
<br />"I don't know, you can go first if you want, I never used a spear," replied Ana.
<br />"Okay, can I teach you how to use it?" asked Tod.
<br />"Of course, I would love some help!" said Ana, smiling, exciting to learn how to use the spear.
<br />Then Tod and Ana walked close to the water, there were some fish close to the shore.
<br />Tod gave Ana the spear and showed her how to aim it, he told her to wait for the water to be calm and the fish to calm down, then she could shoot.
<br />She waited for some seconds and shot the spear at a fish, she managed to catch it, Ana shouted excitedly.
<br />"You got it! On the first try, hehe," said Tod, smiling at Ana, proud of her.
<br />"Yes! Thanks for teaching me, Tod," said Ana.
<br />"No problem, hehe," said Tod.
<br />
<br />Then Tod caught another, they started grabbing some mud on the river of the forest to make two short walls on the sides of the furnace.
<br />After that, they walked around the forest, trying to find trees with a Y in the middle of the branch.
<br />They cut two of those trees and brought them close to the furnace, then they inserted those branches inside the short walls of mud.
<br />The two found another thin stick and placed it on top of the other two branches shaped like a Y.
<br />Ana grabbed one fish and cleaned it, removing scales with the stone that looked like a knife and removing the things inside of it.
<br />Then she grabbed the stick from the top of the two branches and started to put the fish on the stick.
<br />The fire was getting a little bit low, Tod walked to the forest to grab more wood and sticks.
<br />He returned and started refueling the fire, Ana placed the stick with the fish on top of the two sticks shaped like a Y.
<br />The fish started to cook, Ana and Tod waited patiently, looking at the fish.
<br />Ana got up to catch a banana in a tree, she grabbed it and ate it.
<br />Tod looked up to the sky and noticed it was afternoon, only some hours left to be night.
<br />After waiting some minutes, the fish was cooked, Tod removed it from the stick and said for Ana to hold it.
<br />He grabbed a large stone and walked close to where Ana was, he left the stone on the ground and grabbed the fish.
<br />Tod placed the fish on top of the stone and cut it in half, removing the bones and thorns.
<br />They both started to eat the fish, smiling at each other, the fish tasted delicious even if it did not have salt or spices.
<br />They cooked the other fish and ate it too.
<br />
<br />Ana was very happy there, she did not think about home, about the crystals, she just enjoyed the moment for what it was.
<br />She was happy to survive and build things together with Tod, it was very fun.
<br />"Hey, Tod, I loved to build this with you, it was so exciting!" said Ana, smiling.
<br />"Hehe, I'm happy that you think that, Ana, it was fun to survive along with you," said Tod, smiling too.
<br />"So... Can we go home?" asked Ana.
<br />"Why do you want to go home?" asked Tod.
<br />"It is because your mother is worried about you, she didn't know where you'd gone, you just disappeared out of nowhere," replied Ana.
<br />"Oh... My mom is always worried about me, I keep leaving home without saying anything..." said Tod, looking down, a little sad.
<br />"Me too... They're always worried about me too..." said Ana.
<br />"Really?... Hmm..." said Tod, "It was good to survive and build things with you, Ana, thanks, hehe, let's go back home? I'll show you where I live".
<br />"Sure! I would love for you to show me the place," said Ana, smiling at Tod.
<br />Then Ana activated her wings and Tod turned into a hawk-like bird again.
<br />Ana and Tod grabbed a banana from a tree, they started flying low on the island, looking at the campfire, the furnace, stones, axes, knife-like stones, the spear.

They started flying, Ana was following Tod because he knew the way to the Mountains of Aris, his home.
<br />Ana was looking at the sunset, it was very beautiful, the ocean was moving a little because of the wind, some fish jumped off the water and came back inside it.
<br />There were birds close to Ana and Tod, one bird looked at Tod with some curiosity, asking itself if Tod was a real bird or not.
<br />After some time flying, Ana and Tod arrived at the Mountains of Aris, Sophia was there on the shore of the beach, looking at them.
<br />They both landed at the sand and Sophia looked at Tod, smiling, happy to have her son back.
<br />"Thank you so much, Ana, for bringing my son back, I was very worried," said Sophia, smiling while looking at Ana, she hugged Tod tight.
<br />"I'm sorry for worrying you, mom," said Tod, looking sad at Sophia.
<br />"It's okay my dear, let's eat, food is ready," said Sophia, starting to walk to the village of the Kódeks.
<br />"Can Ana stay, mom?" asked Tod.
<br />"Of course, son, she is welcome here," said Sophia, smiling at Ana.
<br />"Come on," said Tod smiling lightly while looking at Ana.
<br />The trio started walking to the village of the Kódeks.
<br />Ana looked at the crystals and the Kódeks of the village, everyone walking around and doing stuff.
<br />Sophia started walking to the canteen, Tod, and Ana following her.
<br />They arrived at the canteen, Ana and Tod sat together at a table, Sophia brought some food for them, they started to eat together.
<br />"Here is very good, at the Mountains of Aris, it is a good place to spend some time," said Tod, looking at Ana.
<br />"Yeah, I agree, here is very good Tod, hehe," said Ana, smiling while looking at Tod.
<br />"Hey, Ana, is there anything you're interested in? Like, learning something new..." asked Tod while eating sometimes.
<br />"Yes, I wanted to discover the mystery of the crystals, I and my race doesn't know how they appeared on the ground or what is their origin," said Ana.
<br />"Oh, we know the mystery of them, but people here don't care about it too much, it's too mundane for them.
<br />We already use the crystals in a way, but I want you to discover by yourself, hehe.
<br />Take a visit to our library, probably there's a book with the origin story of the crystals, but we have a lot of books, hehe," said Tod, smiling.
<br />"Okay, thanks, Tod, I'll take a look later, thank you for receiving me here," said Ana.
<br />"No problem, Ana, you're a friend to me, is always good to have you around," said Tod, smiling gently at Ana.
<br />"Hehe, thanks," replied Ana, smiling too.
<br />They both finished eating, Sophia said she was going to sleep a little at her hut, Ana thanked them for receiving her there and waved her hand.
<br />Tod said that he was going to play some ball with the kids in the center of the village.
<br />"Go there if you need anything, Ana," said Tod, smiling.
<br />"Thanks, Tod," said Ana, smiling.
<br />
<br />Then Ana started walking in the village, she asked a Kódek where the library was, he pointed her the way.
<br />She started flying to the library, Ana arrived there and flew high in the library, she picked up four books to read.
<br />The fairy sat at one table in the library and started reading, she was reading a book of the story of the Kódeks, maybe there was something about the crystals there.
<br />She grabbed some fruits from the canteen some minutes ago, before she, Tod, and Sophia ate, she left those fruits close to her on the table in case she became hungry.
<br />The book told the story of the Kódeks, their secrets, how they lived, how they arrived at the Mountains of Aris.
<br />Ana looked to her right, there was a Soul Wasp there, reading a book, she had orange hair and an orange body, her body was shining.
<br />(I imagine the Orange Soul Wasp being the Flame Princess from the cartoon Adventure Time, but with fairy wings and a shining body like a soul.)
<br />Ana thought that she was so beautiful, so shiny, she liked how the Soul Wasps looked, they looked like angels.
<br />Then Ana continued reading her book, the Soul Wasp flew close to her, she looked at the book that Ana was reading.
<br />"Hey, what are you reading?" asked the Soul Wasp.
<br />"Oh, hey," said Ana, getting a little surprised, she did not see the Soul Wasp coming close to her, "I'm reading the story of the Kódeks".
<br />"Oh, that's interesting, they have a pretty great and rich story, I liked to read it," said the Soul Wasp.
<br />"Hehe, yeah, I agree... Are you reading something?" asked Ana.
<br />"Yes, I'm reading a book that tells about the Soul Wasps and the Fairies," replied the Soul Wasp.
<br />"Oh, that sounds interesting, can I read it too?" asked Ana.
<br />"Of course! You're a fairy right?" asked the Soul Wasp.
<br />"Yes, I'm a fairy," replied Ana.
<br />"Oh, I always thought Fairies were quite cute, their wings are so cute and beautiful, ehehe," said the Soul Wasp.
<br />"Hehe, thanks, I always thought Soul Wasps were cute too, their body is really beautiful, their light.
<br />The way they shine, it is marvelous, astounding to look at," said Ana, smiling to the Soul Wasp, a little flushed.
<br />"Hehe, I'm happy that you think that, thanks," said the Soul Wasp, smiling while being a little flushed.
<br />"Maybe we can switch books if you want, I would like to read the story of the Kódeks too, again, hehe," said the Soul Wasp.
<br />"Okay, that sounds good, can I ask your name?" asked Ana.
<br />"Yes, my name is Rose," replied the Soul Wasp.
<br />"My name is Ana," said Ana.
<br />"Okay... I'll continue reading my book, tell me when you wanna read it okay?" asked Rose.
<br />"Okay, thanks, Rose," said Ana, smiling at her.
<br />Rose walked back to her chair and continued reading the book that tells about the Soul Wasps and the Fairies.
<br />Ana continued reading the book of the story of the Kódeks.
<br />
<br />Ana looked at Rose and asked, "Hey, Rose, do you know anything about the crystals?"
<br />"Yes, actually, I already read about them in here, it was the reason why I wanted to go here, it's because the Kódeks know the secret of the crystals," said Rose, getting up and walking close to Ana.
<br />"The chapter where they tell about the crystals is the fourth chapter of the book, on page one hundred thirteen," said Rose, looking at the book of the story of the Kódeks.
<br />Then Ana moved a few pages, trying to find the fourth chapter and page one hundred thirteen.
<br />She found it and thanked Rose, then Rose walked back to her chair, sitting and continuing to read her book.
<br />Ana started reading chapter four, which reads:
<br />"At the beginning of the Kódek civilization, before the Big Curse of the Temacians, an evil race, the Kódeks have migrated to an island.
<br />They found a lot of crystals on that island, coming from the ground, some small ones, still growing.
<br />They were very beautiful, there were red, blue, cyan, pink, orange, yellow, white, black, and green crystals.
<br />The Kódeks did not know where those crystals came from.
<br />But after some Kódek Scientists and Researchers studied the crystals and the environment, they found out that a great entity planted those crystals there, with crystal seeds.
<br />They do not have crystal seeds there and do not know how to obtain them, but they still grew in there and spread.
<br />The Kódeks started building houses and huts on that island, making their home there, planting food and vegetables.
<br />Some Kódeks were in charge of breaking and cleaning the crystals, for them to not invade and take over the island, they could break houses if they grow close to the walls.
<br />One day, a Scientist got a pickax and mined one crystal, it was blue, he wanted to find out what the crystals were made from.
<br />The Kódek scientist grabbed that small blue crystal and studied it, he discovered that it had Potassium (K) in it.
<br />His name was Heckler, he started doing scientific research, giving the blue crystal to Kódeks and analyzing how their body changed, if they had more energy through the day.
<br />He discovered that eating the blue crystals, which had the element Potassium in them, helped Kódeks become stronger and grow faster, it helped them have energy through the day to do stuff.
<br />Heckler was a great Kódek Scientist, he discovered a lot of things.
<br />He continued mining and testing the other crystals, each one of them had a different element and helped the body differently.
<br />Every Kódek nowadays eats crystals just because of his discoveries, of how great those crystals were to the body.
<br />Other races do not have the habit of eating crystals, they really should try if they have the chance."
<br />"Wow, that is a lot to take in, that is so interesting! I have to tell mom and the other fairies about this, they're gonna be crazy!" Ana whispered.
<br />Rose heard her whisper and looked at her, saying, "Yeah, the story is awesome right?
<br />We Soul Wasps eat crystals every day, but we have some kind of medic prescription or some sort of balance.
<br />You don't wanna eat too much of them, bad things could happen".
<br />"Really? That's pretty cool Rose, I'm gonna tell the Fairies about this," said Ana.
<br />"Yeah, hehe, it is really good, I think the Fairies have crystals in the Crystal Lands right?" asked Rose.
<br />"Yes, we have, that will be easy for us, hehe.
<br />We have to cut them every day because they grow fast, they could take over the island," replied Ana, smiling at Rose.
<br />"Hey, can I read your book now please?" asked Rose.
<br />"Of course, I already read the interesting part, hehe," said Ana.
<br />Then Rose walked close to Ana with the book of the Soul Wasps and Fairies in her hand, they switched books.
<br />Ana started reading the book of the Soul Wasps and the Fairies, and Rose started reading the book about the story of the Kódeks.
<br />
<br />After some hours of reading, Ana was a little tired, she stretched and ate something, after that, she put the book back in its place on a bookshelf.
<br />Ana started walking out of the library and waved goodbye to Rose, the Soul Wasp, wanting to meet with her again soon, Ana thought that she was interesting.
<br />She walked to the center of the village and looked for Tod.
<br />Ana found him and started walking close to him, "Hey, Tod, I'm gonna go back home, I need to tell the Fairies about the importance of the crystals," said Ana.
<br />"Oh, okay, Ana, come with me, I'll show you where my hut is so you can say bye to my mother," said Tod.
<br />"Okay," said Ana smiling.
<br />They both started walking to the hut where Sophia, the mother of Tod, was sleeping.
<br />They arrived there and Sophia woke up.
<br />"Hey, Sophia, I'm gonna go back to the Crystal Lands to tell the Fairies about the importance of the crystals.
<br />So I thought it would be good for me to say bye to you first," said Ana.
<br />"Oh, okay my dear," said Sophia, getting up, then she turned into her human form and hugged Ana, smiling.
<br />Ana hugged her back, "Thank you, Ana, for bringing my son back home, you're always welcome here okay?" asked Sophia.
<br />"Thank you for your hospitality, Sophia, and thank you for receiving me here, you're so kind, hehe," said Ana, smiling, "It would be a pleasure to go back here for a visit".
<br />"No problem my dear, see you soon, Ana!" said Sophia, smiling.
<br />"See you soon, Sophia!" said Ana smiling.
<br />Then Ana hugged Tod tight in his human form and smiled at him, "Good luck on your survival things, see you soon, Ana," said Tod smiling.
<br />"Good luck for you too in your survival things Tod, see you soon!" said Ana, smiling.
<br />
<br />Then Ana started flying back to the Crystal Lands.
<br />She arrived there and all the Fairies greet her, smiling, saying they missed her and that she is an important part of the race of the Fairies.
<br />Lindsay gave Ana a big and tight hug, Panda too, they smiled at Ana.
<br />Ana started walking to the hut of her family with Panda and Lindsay.
<br />Jena, Lindsay, and Panda started eating dinner on the table.
<br />Ana smiled and sat with them to eat.
<br />"How was it to be in the Mountains of Aris, where the Kódeks lives, Ana?" asked Jena.
<br />"It was very good, mom, it was a pretty interesting place, I discovered the secrets of the crystals there, reading a book that they had in their library," said Ana while looking at Jena.
<br />"The secret is that the crystals were discovered first by the Kódeks, a Kódek Scientist called Heckler discovered that the crystals had elements in them.
<br />The elements that existed in the crystals gave great health benefits to the body, it helped it grow stronger and faster," said Ana.
<br />"That is pretty interesting my dear, I will tell some fairies to mine the crystals and collect them so we can get the benefit of those elements.
<br />We are gonna make some tests to see if that works, then, if the tests say that it works, we are going to start eating crystals too, along with food," said Jena smiling.
<br />After that, Ana finished eating and walked to her bedroom to sleep a little, she slept, listening to an owl, the water of the ocean hitting the shore.
<br />And the wind blowing on the trees of the island.
<br />After sleeping a little, Ana wakes up and goes to the kitchen, drinking some water.
<br />Then she starts flying to the beach, she sees Lindsay on the shore, looking at the ocean.
<br />Ana flies close to her and sits beside her.
<br />"Hey, Lindsay, what are you doing here?" asks Ana, curious.
<br />"I'm just thinking, sis, it's that I feel stuck on this island... I'm always here, just doing the stuff that normal fairies do.
<br />Just flying, collecting stuff, making magic and spells, playing ball..." said Lindsay, looking at the ground, a little sad.
<br />"Oh... I understand... I felt that too some months ago, that's why I left... That's why I always leave, it's because I feel stuck in here, and I don't think that I'm meant to be here...
<br />Of course, this is where I was born, and I should visit here, but I don't need to stay here... Do you understand?" asked Ana.
<br />"Yes..." replied Lindsay, who hugged Ana tight and closed her eyes.
<br />Ana embraced Lindsay and smiled a little, closing her eyes.
<br />"So... What should I do, sis?" asked Lindsay, opening her eyes.
<br />"Do you want to travel through islands with me when I go to them?
<br />This way you can think a little and reflect, think about what you want to do.
<br />And stay a little away from the opinions, thoughts, and expectations of others," asked Ana, breaking out from the hug and smiling at Lindsay.
<br />"Of course I want sis! It would be awesome, thanks...
<br />It would be good to take some time off to relax and think about life, reflect, hehe," replied Lindsay, hugging Ana again and smiling a lot.
<br />"Hehe, okay, sis, it will be very good to have your company, do you want me to teach you survival skills?" asked Ana.
<br />"Yes, I want to learn it with the best!" said Lindsay, smiling while looking at Ana.
<br />"Hehe, I'm not too good at surviving, sis, but thank you.
<br />Let's go to sleep?" asked Ana smiling.
<br />"Yes, little sis," replied Lindsay.
<br />They both started walking to the hut of their parents, Ana said goodnight to Lindsay, and Lindsay said goodnight back.
<br />They walked to their bedrooms, laid on the bed, and slept.

"Hehe, okay, sis, it will be very good to have your company, do you want me to teach you survival skills?" asked Ana.
<br />"Yes, I want to learn it with the best!" said Lindsay, smiling while looking at Ana.
<br />"Hehe, I'm not too good at surviving, sis, but thank you.
<br />Let's go to sleep?" asked Ana smiling.
<br />"Okay, sis," said Lindsay.
<br />They both started walking to the hut of their parents, Ana said goodnight to Lindsay, and Lindsay said goodbye back.
<br />They walked to their bedrooms, laid on the bed, and slept.
<br />
<br />...
<br />
<br />Then, after waking up, Ana got up and walked to the kitchen, Jena had already made breakfast.
<br />Ana sat at the table, Lindsay and Panda were there too, Ana started to eat with them.
<br />"Hey, sis, do you want to take a bath at the ocean after we eat?" asked Lindsay, smiling.
<br />"Yes, a bath would be relaxing right now, even if I relaxed a lot while sleeping," replied Ana, smiling.
<br />Ana and her sisters finished eating, they started walking to the beach.
<br />Lindsay and Panda had necklaces too, they also gave them magic and spells.
<br />Lindsay had a necklace with a green jewel, it was given by her father, which was a fairy too.
<br />The necklace of Panda was purple, it was given by a friend of hers, that friend left the fairy colony some months ago to live alone, surviving on an island.
<br />Ana started walking to the ocean, she started swimming, Lindsay and Panda did the same thing.
<br />(A good bath in the ocean is always relaxing... Hmm... The chill water, closing your nose and submerging into the water, how relaxing...)
<br />Ana made a spell with the help of her necklace to throw some water in Lindsay and Panda, the trio smiled.
<br />Lindsay made a spell with her necklace that made it possible for the three to breathe underwater.
<br />The three started exploring the depths of the ocean, looking at the fishes and other marine creatures.
<br />It was so good to feel the chill water touch and cover their bodies, making them relax, making them feel the water and swim with it.
<br />They felt so happy and relaxed there, swimming while looking at the corals, the fishes, the sand, what a delightful feeling.
<br />Then the trio swam back to the surface, they noticed that they were a little far from the beach and the island.
<br />They submerged into the water again and started swimming back to the island.
<br />(This reminds me of a chapter of Desert Island where the character swam on the water, a little far, then came back to his island.)
<br />Ana got out of the water and started walking close to some fairy kids.
<br />"Hey, do you guys wanna breathe underwater?" asked Ana, Lindsay walked close to them, Panda did the same.
<br />"Yes!" replied the kids, smiling at Ana.
<br />Then Lindsay told them to get closer together, Lindsay made the spell using her necklace and the kids could now breathe underwater.
<br />They thanked Ana and Lindsay, smiling, then walked close to the water and begin to swim, smiling and breathing underwater.
<br />"Hey girls, I think I'm gonna take a bath and then I'm gonna go to an island," said Ana, looking at her sisters.
<br />"Okay, can I come with you, Ana?" asked Lindsay, looking at Ana's eyes.
<br />"Of course sis! Hehe," replied Ana, smiling, "Do you wanna come too?" asked her, looking at Panda.
<br />"No, thanks sis, I think I'm gonna stay here taking care of mom and the village, also, mom said that the experiment of the crystals will begin today in the afternoon," explained Panda.
<br />"Oh, okay, tell me how it was after it is finished okay?" asked Ana.
<br />"Okay sis, good luck on that island, hehe," said Panda, smiling at Ana and Lindsay.
<br />"Thanks, little sis!" said Ana smiling.
<br />
<br />Then Ana flew to her hut, where her parents lived, she walked to the bathroom and took a bath.
<br />Then she walked close to Lindsay, which was in the living room.
<br />"Hey sis, do you wanna go now?" asked Ana.
<br />"Yes, I just gotta take a quick bath okay?" asked Lindsay.
<br />"Okay, I'll wait for you, hehe," said Ana.
<br />Lindsay then took a bath, she walked to the kitchen and ate something, then she walked to the living room where Ana was.
<br />They both told Panda that they were leaving, they hugged Panda and she hugged them back.
<br />The two walked to where their mother was and told her that they were going to an island, it was still morning.
<br />Jena hugged them and the two hugged her back, smiling, Jena was going to miss their daughters.
<br />Then Ana and Lindsay started flying, they flew high and hold her necklaces.
<br />Ana started looking for a good island where she had not gone before, Lindsay was following her.
<br />She stayed at a lot of islands, surviving, so she left her stuff there, the axes, baskets, food, and other tools.
<br />Ana found a good island and flew close to it, she landed on the sand, Lindsay did that too.
<br />"Is this the island that we're gonna stay, sis?" asked Lindsay, looking at Ana.
<br />"Yes, do you like it?" asked Ana, smiling.
<br />"Yes, it is pretty beautiful and big, hehe," replied Lindsay smiling, she was happy to survive along with her sister.
<br />So Ana started looking for a sharp stone that looked like a knife, she told Lindsay to do the same.
<br />Lindsay found one and gave it to Ana, she smiled.
<br />Ana walked close to some stones and grabbed a large one, she walked to the ocean and soaked it in water.
<br />"This is needed for you to sharpen the stone, so you can cut stuff with it," said Ana.
<br />"So you sharpen the stone with another stone but it is wet?" asked Lindsay, curious.
<br />"Yes," replied Ana.
<br />Then Ana grabbed the stone and left it close to the edge between the forest and the beach.
<br />Ana told Lindsay to get closer, Lindsay walked close and sat beside her.
<br />Ana started sharpening the stone by scraping it on the larger stone.
<br />She gave the stone for Lindsay to try, Lindsay managed to sharpen the stone, it was very good, Ana was proud.
<br />Then Ana walked to a tree and grabbed a thick stick, she showed Lindsay how to cut the tree when you do not have an ax.
<br />Lindsay grabbed both of them and cut the tree very easily.
<br />"I'm gonna show you how you make an ax, sis," said Ana.
<br />"Okay, I'm so excited, hehe," said Lindsay smiling.
<br />Then Ana cut the tree in half and told Lindsay to make a hole in the half tree to put a sharp stone in there.
<br />Lindsay did the hole and smiled at Ana, Ana was proud.
<br />Ana walked to the forest and looked for a rectangular stone, she found one and brought it close to where Lindsay was sitting.
<br />"Now you need to sharpen this rectangular stone to serve as the blade for the ax, then you put the stone inside the hole," said Ana.
<br />Lindsay grabbed the rectangular stone and sharpened it using the big wet stone.
<br />Then she grabbed the thick tree branch with a hole and inserted the rectangular stone inside it.
<br />Lindsay grabbed another thick tree branch and started hitting the rectangular stone with it to attach the stone tight to the ax handle.
<br />She finished making the ax, Lindsay smiled at Ana, "Thanks, sis, I'm so proud of this ax, hehe," said Lindsay, smiling.
<br />"No problem, sis, hehe, I loved to teach you, you're very good," said Ana, smiling.
<br />
<br />Then Ana got up and started walking to the forest, she arrived there and started gathering dry leaves and tree branches.
<br />She left those dry leaves and tree branches in a place close to the big wet stone.
<br />"Now we gonna start to make a fire okay?" asked Ana.
<br />"Okay, sis," said Lindsay, smiling, willing to learn.
<br />"So, arrange these dry leaves and tree branches like a campfire," said Ana.
<br />Lindsay did that, after that, she waited for her sister's instructions.
<br />"Now get two sticks, and make three holes in one," said Ana.
<br />Lindsay got up and looked for two sticks in the forest, she grabbed them and walked back to Ana, grabbing the stone knife and making three holes in one.
<br />"Put the stick with the holes on top of the dry leaves," said Ana.
<br />Lindsay placed the stick with holes on top of the dry leaves.
<br />Then Ana said for her to get another stick and put it on one hole of the stick with holes, she did that and started rotating the stick with no holes.
<br />Smoke started to come out of the dry leaves after Lindsay started rotating the stick.
<br />Lindsay grabbed the dry leaves and started blowing them.
<br />Ana said for her to put the dry leaves on top of the sticks and tree branches after the fire starts.
<br />Lindsay did that and the fire started, she kept adding sticks and tree branches to fuel it.
<br />Ana clapped and smiled at Lindsay, "Congrats sis! You just did fire!" said Ana.
<br />"Hehe, thanks sis, I could do this with your help, you helped me a lot, thanks," said Lindsay smiling.
<br />"Hehe, are you hungry? I think it is almost afternoon," asked Ana.
<br />"Yes, I'm a little hungry, what are we gonna eat?" asked Lindsay.
<br />"First we need something to catch the food," said Ana.
<br />"Hmm... A spear?" asked Lindsay.
<br />"Exactly, we need to find a good thin tree to cut it down and use it as the spear," said Ana.
<br />Then they started walking to the forest, looking for that type of tree, Lindsay was holding the ax.
<br />Ana found a thin tree and told Lindsay to use the ax to cut it.
<br />Lindsay cut it down and grabbed the thin log, they started walking back to the campfire.
<br />They sat on the ground and Ana told Lindsay to put the tip of the spear into the fire to char the blunt tip, she did that.
<br />Then Lindsay scraped the burning tip of the spear in a large stone to sharpen it.
<br />After that, Lindsay grabbed a piece of wood and polished the tip of the spear with it.
<br />"Good work, sis!" said Ana smiling.
<br />"Thanks, sis! Can we fish something?" asked Lindsay.
<br />"Yes, I'm gonna teach you how to use the spear to catch fish," said Ana, walking to the shore of the beach, close to the water.
<br />Lindsay walked there too, holding the spear.
<br />Ana taught Lindsay how to aim the spear at the water, she said for her to wait for the water to get calm and the fish to calm down.
<br />After that, Lindsay looked at the water, looking for some fish, she waited for a little and shot the spear, aiming at a fish.
<br />She got one fish on the first try, Ana was smiling, proud of her sister.
<br />"Hehe, you're like a prodigy sis, you're so good at this!" said Ana smiling.
<br />"Thanks, sis, I learned with the best, hehe," said Lindsay, smiling at Ana.
<br />
<br />Then Ana grabbed the fish from the spear Lindsay and left it on top of a stone.
<br />"Now let's skin the fish to remove its scales so we can eat it," said Ana.
<br />Then Lindsay grabbed the knife stone and grabbed the fish, removing the scales of it.
<br />After that, Ana helped Lindsay to search for tree branches shaped like a Y.
<br />They found them and cut them down, after that, they placed those branches inside the ground, close to the campfire.
<br />Then they found another good branch and walked back to the campfire, Lindsay grabbed the fish and put it on the tree branch.
<br />Lindsay placed more branches on the fire and placed the tree branch with the fish on top of the two branches shaped like a Y.
<br />They were making a spit of a fish, the fish started to cook very nicely.
<br />Lindsay hugged Ana tight and smiled at her, happy for doing the ax, the campfire, and cooking the fish.
<br />"Thanks for helping me and teaching me about a lot of things of survival sis, hehe," said Lindsay, smiling.
<br />"I'm always happy to teach you things, sis, it is good to teach the others what we know," said Ana, smiling.
<br />They waited for the fish to cook, Lindsay walked close to it to check it and it was good.
<br />Lindsay removed the fish from the stick, Ana grabbed the spear and caught a fish for her, then she skinned it.
<br />Ana placed the raw fish in the stick and placed it on top of the two sticks for it to cook.
<br />She waited for the fish to get ready and placed the cooked fish on top of a stone, cutting it in half and removing thorns and bones, Lindsay did that too.
<br />They both started eating their fish, smiling at each other, the fish was delicious.
<br />"What can we do right now, sis?" asked Lindsay, looking at Ana.
<br />"Are you tired?" asked Ana.
<br />"Just a little, what about you?" asked Lindsay.
<br />"Just a little too, do you want to sleep?" asked Ana.
<br />"Yes," replied Lindsay.
<br />Then they both lied on the sand close to the fire and started to sleep, relaxing and resting.

She waited for the fish to get ready and placed the cooked fish on top of a stone, cutting it in half and removing thorns and bones, Lindsay did that too.
<br />They both started eating their fish, smiling at each other, the fish was delicious.
<br />"What can we do right now, sis?" asked Lindsay, looking at Ana.
<br />"Are you tired?" asked Ana.
<br />"Just a little, what about you?" asked Lindsay.
<br />"Just a little too, do you want to sleep?" asked Ana.
<br />"Yes," replied Lindsay.
<br />Then they both lied on the sand close to the fire and started to sleep, relaxing and resting.
<br />
<br />...
<br />
<br />After that, they woke up, Ana walked to the forest to search for some mud.
<br />She found and grabbed it with her hands, she walked close to the ashes of the fire and left the mud there.
<br />Ana started the fire again and refueled it, she made two jars of mud and left them close to the fire to dry.
<br />Then Ana walked to the ocean and filled one jar with water.
<br />Ana and Lindsay made some bricks with mud and made a furnace around the campfire.
<br />After that, Ana made a lid of mud, she placed the lid on top of the furnace for it to dry.
<br />Then Lindsay placed the jar with water on top of the furnace and placed the lid on it, the water started to boil.
<br />After waiting for some minutes, Ana picked up two pieces of wood and grabbed the hot jar with them.
<br />She waited for the water to chill, while waiting, she made two cups of mud and placed them close to the fire, waiting for them to dry.
<br />The water was chill now, Ana and Lindsay drank one cup of water, they were happy about the things they built.
<br />Ana and Lindsay looked at the sun, the waves of the ocean, the birds, they listened to nature, it was so good.
<br />They were relaxed and calm, listening to the sounds of nature, feeling the chill breeze, lying on the sand.
<br />The two looked at the birds, they could fly just like them, they were happy to be able to fly.
<br />Because they felt free and relaxed, it was good to look at the islands and see them from far away, see every part of them.
<br />They just enjoyed that moment, not thinking about their family, their problems, the future, or the past.
<br />Just relaxing and enjoying the current moment, the present, the infinite moment, it is full of good things to do.
<br />Ana and Lindsay closed their eyes, they imagined a world inside a crystal, where people could live.
<br />Then they imagined an empty world, an empty void with nothing, just an infinite white floor, and no walls.
<br />You could walk forever in there and you would not find an end or a wall.
<br />They thought about that place, about that void, they thought that it would be really good to be there.
<br />To just think about nothing and relax, relax your mind, not thinking about anything, not thinking about problems, the past or the future, just feeling, listening.
<br />They thought that it would be good for them to meditate a little, to feel the world a little, feel nature.
<br />Because that is something that is been here since forever, and all the other things were things that men created.
<br />So they enjoyed nature at that moment, just feeling the sand, the sun, feeling the wind, listening to the ocean, the birds, the trees shaking.
<br />They thought that void was like lying on the sand, it was relaxing, empty, simple, not too many things to think about.
<br />Ana always felt that when she survived and built nature things on desert islands, that relaxation, and calm.
<br />Lindsay felt that for the first time, that connection with mother nature and the Earth, was so good for her, it was a new feeling.
<br />Lindsay was very happy, smiling from ear to ear with her eyes closed.
<br />Ana was happy too, she could show Lindsay how nature was awesome and relaxing.
<br />
<br />Then Ana got up, she looked at Lindsay, "Hey sis, do you wanna take a bath on the ocean?" asked Ana.
<br />"Yes, it looks as relaxing as being laid on the sand, feeling nature and listening to it," replied Lindsay, smiling.
<br />"Hehe, okay," said Ana, who started walking close to the ocean, Lindsay followed her.
<br />They started walking deeper into the water, it was going from their toes to their tummy, then to their neck, they started swimming and holding their breath.
<br />Ana and Lindsay started swimming together, submerging into the ocean and feeling the chill water around them, they were happy, smiling.
<br />Ana held her necklace and made a spell for both of them to be able to breathe underwater, it was so relaxing.
<br />They submerged deeper and deeper inside the ocean, looking at the fishes and the corals, exploring the ocean, the unknown.
<br />Lindsay made a spell using her necklace, now they both could shoot waves of water from their feet, just like motorboats does.
<br />They swam quickly in the water, going back and forth, the fishes looked at them with curiosity.
<br />The two swam back to the surface and smiled at each other, the water going off their heads, they stayed on the surface, hovering.
<br />"It is so good to swim with you little sis, hehe," said Lindsay, smiling.
<br />"Hehe, I'm glad you like it, sis," replied Ana.
<br />"The fairies probably already began collecting the elements from the crystals by now," said Lindsay.
<br />"Oh, that's good, do you want to go there to check it?" asked Ana.
<br />"No, I want to stay here with you sis, hehe," replied Lindsay smiling.
<br />"Okay," said Ana, smiling too.
<br />
<br />They looked at the island and its trees, palm trees, the sand.
<br />The two began to swim back to the island, feeling the water run through their bodies.
<br />Ana and Lindsay got off the water and started walking on the sand, the fire was a little low but was still active.
<br />Ana grabbed the ax and cut four trees, she thought about making a house, she and Lindsay grabbed the four logs and brought them close to the fire.
<br />Then Ana walked to a good place in the forest, she started arranging the terrain to make a hut there, making the terrain flatter.
<br />Lindsay helped her, she finished cleaning the terrain and walked close to the campfire, she sat on the ground and cut two logs in half.
<br />Leaving her with four half logs or smaller logs, she brought them close to the cleaned terrain and dug four holes on the ground in a square shape.
<br />Ana gave the four logs to Lindsay and she placed all of them inside the holes that Ana made.
<br />Then Ana grabbed a thick stick and dug a hole in the middle of two logs that were inside the ground.
<br />She walked close to the campfire and grabbed one log that was not cut in half.
<br />After that, she walked to the place where they were building the hut, Ana inserted the tall log inside the hole that she made in the middle of the two smaller logs.
<br />It was going to be the support for the roof of grass that Ana was thinking of making.
<br />Then Lindsay dug a hole on the opposite side of the tall log that Ana placed inside the ground.
<br />She walked close to the campfire and grabbed the other log that was not cut in half, then she walked back to where Ana was.
<br />Lindsay inserted the tall log inside the hole she had made in the middle of the other two smaller logs.
<br />Ana walked deeper into the forest and grabbed some vines to use as mooring.
<br />Then she left the vines on the floor, inside the square made of logs.
<br />Ana grabbed the ax and cut three more trees, she brought them to the square where they were making the hut.
<br />Then Ana grabbed one log and the vines, she placed one side of the log on the top of the tall log, she tied the logs together.
<br />After that, Ana lifted the other side of the horizontal log to tie it with the other tall log.
<br />Lindsay held the log for her and Ana tied up the two logs together.
<br />Then Ana grabbed one more log that she had cut and placed it close to the two small logs on the left side of the hut.
<br />She tied the two sides of the horizontal log with the two small logs with the help of Lindsay.
<br />Ana did the same with the right side of the hut, tying them up together.
<br />"Hey sis, can you bring me six logs please?" asked Ana.
<br />"Of course, hehe," said Lindsay, who grabbed the ax and walked deeper into the forest, cutting six trees.
<br />
<br />She returned with the six logs, bringing two at a time.
<br />Ana made three rafters with those six logs, each of them was two logs tied together to make a frame for the roof of the hut.
<br />Lindsay and Ana placed the three rafters on top of the hut, making the frame of the roof.
<br />One on the front of the hut, one on the middle, and one on the back of the hut.
<br />Ana tied the three rafters together with the three horizontal logs with the help of the vines.
<br />Then Ana cut two more trees and cut them in half, she made two holes in the middle of the two sides of the hut, the front and the back of the hut, in the middle of the two logs on each side.
<br />She placed two logs inside the holes, one on each hole, one log on the left side of the hut, and one on the right side.
<br />Then Lindsay grabbed the ax and cut ten trees, they had thin logs, Lindsay brought all of them to where Ana was.
<br />Ana started adding logs to the frame of the roof where the grass would be.
<br />She used five logs on the left side and five on the right side.
<br />Then Ana cut one tree, cut it in half, and brought it to the hut.
<br />After that, she made two holes on the ground, all on the back of the hut.
<br />One between the support of the roof and the small log on the left, and another between the support of the roof and the small log on the right side, making the back of the hut.
<br />Ana and Lindsay grabbed a stone blade each, it was a sharp stone that could be used to cut things.
<br />They walked around the forest looking for grass to cut, to use as the roof of the hut.
<br />Ana and Lindsay managed to get some packs of grass to use as the roof.
<br />The two walked to the place where the hut was being built.
<br />Lindsay placed the grass and Ana tied it to the roof using the vines.
<br />After some minutes of placing the grass and tying it up to the roof, they finished making the roof of the hut.
<br />Ana grabbed a stick and grabbed some grass with it, lifting it and placing it on top of the roof to fill the gaps where rain would go inside the hut.
<br />
<br />Then Lindsay grabbed the ax and cut some trees to make the wall of the hut.
<br />She brought the logs to the place where the hut was being built.
<br />Ana used the logs that Lindsay brought to weave in and out of the logs of the hut, making the wall and leaving the front of the hut with no wall, for entrance.
<br />Ana and Lindsay walked to a river that existed in the forest, they grabbed some mud and walked back to the hut.
<br />They started plastering the walls with the mud, covering the logs with it.
<br />After that, they plastered all the walls, Ana and Lindsay also used the mud to plaster the floor, making it flat, clean, and good to lie in.
<br />The mud stays on provided the roof keeps the rain off.
<br />Then Ana and Lindsay made a fire inside the hut to dry out the grass and the mud walls.
<br />After that, Ana filled one jar of mud with water and walked to the furnace, she placed the jar on top of the furnace with the lid on.
<br />Then she walked to the forest to grab some sticks and branches to use as fuel for the campfire that was like a furnace.
<br />The water in the jar started boiling, after waiting for a little, Ana grabbed the jar with two thick branches and waited for it to cool down.
<br />Ana then grabbed the jar and two cups of mud, she walked to the hut and sat on the floor, filling two cups of water, one for her and one for Lindsay.
<br />They drank the water, looking at the ocean, the front of the hut was facing the ocean, they looked at the water moving and the waves forming.
<br />There was a cool breeze in there, it was good to spend some time on that island.
<br />Ana got up and walked to a banana tree, she picked up two bananas, one for her and one for Lindsay.
<br />Then she walked back to the hut and gave one banana to Lindsay.
<br />Both of them ate while smiling at each other, feeling nature.
<br />"It is so good to survive with you sis, hehe, I'm so happy," said Lindsay smiling.
<br />"I think the same, sis, thanks for spending some time with me, I'm so lonely sometimes, surviving alone, it is good to have some company," said Ana, smiling.
<br />"Hehe, I'm glad to be your company, sis," said Lindsay, who then hugged Ana tight, smiling.
<br />Ana returned the hug and smiled, they lied on the floor of the hut, they were a little tired, it was almost night.
<br />It started raining a little, a calm and relaxing rain, it watered the roof of the hut, it shook all the trees.
<br />The rain probably put out the fire that was close to the shore of the island.
<br />They slept while listening to the calm rain, making the island colder, but still good to sleep in, the fire inside the hut could warm them if they needed it.

In the morning, Lindsay woke up and Ana did not, Lindsay grabbed the two cups and the jar.
<br />She walked close to the furnace and ignited the fire, then she boiled some water for both of them to drink.
<br />Lindsay walked back to the hut and left the jar of water close to Ana, Lindsay drank one cup of water and looked at Ana, she caressed her hair.
<br />Then Lindsay grabbed one banana and ate it, after that, she grabbed two bananas and left them at the side of the jar of water, for Ana to drink and eat when she wakes up.
<br />After that, Lindsay grabbed the spear and walked close to the ocean, trying to catch a fish.
<br />She got two and placed both of them on the sticks above the furnace to cook them.
<br />Lindsay skinned the fishes, then cooked them, she cut them in half and removed the thorns, bones, and other things that were not eatable.
<br />Then Lindsay grabbed a medium stone, brought the stone to the hut, then placed one cooked fish on top of it for Ana to eat.
<br />Lindsay ate her fish and drank one cup of water, smiling, the fish tasted delicious.
<br />After that, Lindsay left the ax, spear, sharp stone blade, and fire sticks out of the hut.
<br />She started flying, she flew high in the sky and started looking to the islands that were far away.
<br />Lindsay asked herself where the Crystal Lands were, she held her necklace and felt where home was, she looked to the right.
<br />After that, she landed on the sand, looking at the hut, spear, ax, campfire, and furnace.
<br />Ana woke up, drank the water, ate the two bananas and the fish, then she walked out of the hut, looking for Lindsay.
<br />"Hey sis, thanks for making breakfast for me, hehe," said Ana smiling.
<br />"No problem, hehe, I like to take care of you, you're my younger sister after all," said Lindsay, smiling.
<br />"Hehe, hey sis, do you want to go back home to check the status of the crystal experiment with me?
<br />We can go back to this island later if you want," asked Ana.
<br />"Yes, I want, can you do a spell for us to be able to locate this island when we want to go back?" asked Lindsay.
<br />"Yeah, I'll do it," replied Ana, who held her necklace and made a sphere with yellow borders that looked like neon.
<br />"How should we name this island?" asked Ana.
<br />"We should name it 'The Hut, Spear and Ax Island'," replied Lindsay.
<br />"That's a good name," said Ana, who named that island "The Hut, Spear, and Ax Island", that name appeared on top of the yellow sphere.
<br />They could hold their necklaces and they would feel where that island was located, just like a GPS or compass.
<br />After that, Ana and Lindsay took flight, they held their necklaces to feel where home was, then they started flying there.
<br />
<br />Then, after some time flying, both of them arrived there, they landed on the sand, there were some fairies there.
<br />"Do you know where my mom is?" asked Ana, looking at one of the fairies.
<br />"Yes, she is in her hut," replied one fairy.
<br />Then Ana and Lindsay flew to their hut, they found Jena sitting on a chair at the kitchen table.
<br />"Hey mom, we're back," said Ana to Jena.
<br />"Hey my dear, you're here," said Jena, who got up to hug Lindsay and Ana.
<br />"So, how is the experiment going?" asked Ana.
<br />"Well, we did a lot of tests, some fairies were becoming stronger after each day, and they had a lot of energy to do things through the day.
<br />I told them to start eating crystals every day because they were good for their health.
<br />I put a fairy in charge of being a nutritionist.
<br />To analyze the body and the health of the fairies to tell them what crystals they should eat and in what quantity," explained Jena.
<br />"Oh, that's very good to hear mom!" said Ana, smiling.
<br />"Hehe, yes, it is a very good thing, you made a very important discovery daughter! I'm so proud of you," said Jena, hugging Ana, and looking at her eyes.
<br />"Thanks, mom, I'm happy that you're proud of me," said Ana, smiling.
<br />"Do you both wanna eat something?" asked Jena.
<br />"Yes, what there's for lunch?" asked Lindsay.
<br />"We have a fish barbecue with lots of vegetables and some spices," said Jena, smiling at her daughters.
<br />"That sounds delicious mom!" said Ana, smiling.
<br />After that, Ana, Lindsay, and Jena sat at the table to eat, the fish barbecue was served.
<br />"Hey, Lindsay, go call Panda, please.
<br />She is playing some ball at the beach," said Jena.
<br />"Okay mom," said Lindsay.
<br />Then she got out of the house to call Panda for lunch, after some seconds, Panda and Lindsay arrived at their mother's hut.
<br />The whole family ate the barbecued fish with vegetables, it was very delicious, Ana ate a little more than everyone, it has been some time since she ate something so delicious.
<br />
<br />After that, Lindsay and Ana walked outside to feel the wind, it was very good, they wanted to relax a little and wait for the food to digest.
<br />Panda walked to the ocean to take a bath in it, it was good to take a bath in the cool ocean on such a hot afternoon.
<br />Ana and Lindsay just sat on the sand, below the leaves of the trees, on the shadow of them, they felt the cool wind.
<br />They looked at the beach and saw some fairies eating blue crystals, they thought about making an appointment with the fairy nutritionist to know what crystals they should eat.
<br />Both of them got up and started flying back to the village, Ana and Lindsay flew to their hut.
<br />They both grabbed a backpack, they placed notepads, books, pencils, pens, and other writing stuff inside the backpacks.
<br />After that, they flew to the town hall, they found Jena there.
<br />"Hey mom, we're gonna go back to that island to do a little more stuff okay?" asked Ana.
<br />"Okay, take care of your sister, Ana, and take care of her too, Lindsay," said Jena, who hugged Ana and Lindsay.
<br />"Okay mom, I'll take care of her, and she'll take care of me, hehe," said Ana, smiling.
<br />"Hehe, yes mom," said Lindsay.
<br />After that, both of them started flying to that island again, holding their necklaces to know where it was, they were wearing the backpacks.
<br />They arrived there, Ana searched for the hut and found it, she grabbed the ax and cut a tree.
<br />Then Ana cut the log in half and made a hole in it, to put a sharp stone inside it.
<br />"Hey, sis, can you bring a rectangular stone for me?" asked Ana.
<br />"Of course, hehe, just give me a minute," replied Lindsay.
<br />Lindsay started looking for a good rectangular stone to give to Ana so she could make another ax.
<br />She found one and brought it to Ana, Ana grabbed it, then she grabbed a large stone, walked to the ocean, and soaked it in water.
<br />After that, Ana started sharpening the stone to make an ax blade.
<br />Ana was sitting on the ground, sharpening the stone, Lindsay was standing, looking at Ana, she saw a blue light at her side.
<br />Suddenly, a strange creature appeared there on the island, it was beside Lindsay, it looked like it came from the sky, from out of the planet.
<br />Its face was a screen, it had a blue dot on its screen, it said that the name of their species was Korvax, they did not have a defined gender.
<br />"There are some aliens that are invading my planet, I think they are of the Gek species.
<br />So I fled here, to this planet, they have a lot of spaceships, landing on my planet even right now...
<br />It was very scary," said the alien, in shock, scared.
<br />"Oh, I understand, how did you flee here?" asked Ana.
<br />"I used my spaceship to get out of my planet.
<br />Then I sent a teleport beam to here, to teleport to the ground, to here where I am right now.
<br />My name is Tetracovix," said the alien.
<br />"Oh, my name is Ana, nice to meet you," said Ana, raising her hand for Tetracovix to hold.
<br />Tetracovix held her hand and shook it, Lindsay said her name and shook its hand too.
<br />"I'm sorry for your planet and your people, Tetracovix," said Ana, sad, looking at the screen of Tetracovix, where she thought its eyes would be.
<br />"Thanks, Ana and Lindsay, I would like some help to go back there and defeat the aliens, the invaders, which are called Geks.
<br />Would you two like to help me?" asked Tetracovix, the Korvax, looking at Ana and Lindsay.
<br />"Uh..." said Ana, looking at Lindsay, "Maybe... Is it too dangerous?" asked Ana, uncertain.
<br />"No, if your spaceship gets destroyed you'll be teleported back to here, I installed that type of system on the spaceship," replied Tetracovix.
<br />"Oh, okay, where is this spaceship?" asked Lindsay.
<br />"It is close to the atmosphere of this planet, high up there," said him, pointing to the sky.
<br />"And why don't you go there to get it?" asked Ana.
<br />"Because my teleport gun can't point to there, because I don't know where the spaceship is exactly.
<br />If I point my teleport gun up it could hit anything physical like an asteroid.
<br />You have wings don't you?" asked Tetracovix.
<br />"Yes, why?" asked Lindsay.
<br />"Because you could fly up there to get the spaceship back.
<br />I'll give you an Exo suit so you can take the pressure of the atmosphere and breathe without air up there," replied Tetracovix.
<br />"Okay... What do you think sister?" asked Ana, looking at Lindsay.
<br />"I guess that's safe... Does this suit have a hole for our wings to go out? We can't fly without them," asked Lindsay.
<br />"Yes, it adapts to your body, so if you have a tail or wings it would make a hole for them," replied Tetracovix.
<br />"Okay... Can you give us that suit right now?" asked Ana.
<br />"Of course," replied him, who grabbed a kind of electronic device that had a screen, Lindsay and Ana had never seen that type of thing before.
<br />He touched two buttons on the touch screen and dragged two suit images in the direction of Lindsay and Ana with its fingers.
<br />After that, Ana and Lindsay now had one Exo suit each, it had a jetpack or jump pack, a survival system, and some armor protection, it also had a hole for their wings.
<br />The items that were inside their backpacks were teleported to the inventory of the Exo suit, the inventory had notepads, books, pencils, and pens.
<br />"Thanks, Tetracovix, we're gonna help you," said Ana, looking at him.
<br />"Yes, we're gonna save your planet," said Lindsay, looking at the suit, then looking at Tetracovix.
<br />"But first, can you tell us about everything about this suit and the spaceship?" asked Ana.
<br />"Yes, of course, I'll also give you two a Multi-tool in case you need to collect some resources there.
<br />And also engage in combat without your spaceship," replied Tetracovix.
<br />"Really? Resources? There are crystals there too?" asked Ana, curious.
<br />"Yes, but there are only red crystals that give plutonium, they can be used to recharge the spaceship's devices, your multi-tool, and the protective layers of your Exo suit," replied Tetracovix.
<br />"Oh, that's cool, hehe," said Ana, smiling.
<br />After that, Tetracovix explained everything about the Exo suit, spaceship, and multi-tool for them.
<br />
<br />Ana and Lindsay started flying up using the Exo suit, they had their multi-tools in hand.
<br />Tetracovix stayed on the island, it knew how to do survival stuff too, it looked at the hut that Ana and Lindsay had made, it looked very good.
<br />He grabbed the spear, caught a fish, and skinned it, then it cooked it using the furnace that Ana and Lindsay had made.
<br />After some minutes of flying, Ana and Lindsay arrived at the spaceship.
<br />It was hovering in the atmosphere, wasting its fuel to stay close to the planet but not be dragged by its gravity.
<br />Ana opened the door of the spaceship and sat at the seat of it, Lindsay sat at the back of Ana.
<br />She pushed some type of accelerator that the spaceship had, moving the steering wheel to move the spaceship.
<br />After that, Ana got far from her planet, she looked at it from far away, she could see all the islands, she saw the Crystal Lands where she lived.
<br />The Mountains of Aris where the Kódeks lived, where Tod lived, and the Clouds of Madness.
<br />Ana oppositely turned the spaceship, she saw the red planet that Tetracovix said it lived on, the spaceship had some type of interplanetary scanner.
<br />She pushed a button and the spaceship scanned the planet where Tetracovix lived, it was called "Gears of the Korvax".
<br />Then Ana turned the spaceship to her planet, she scanned it, it was called "Earth (Crystal Version)".
<br />She could see the galaxy and universe where that planet was, the galaxy was called the "Milky Way", the universe was called "C-512 (Crystal Empire)".
<br />Ana found it weird that the universe had "Crystal Empire" written on it, she thought about it for a while, "Why there is an empire about the crystals? They are something that special?" said her.
<br />"What is the Crystal Empire, sis?" asked Lindsay, looking at the screen.
<br />"I don't know, maybe it is something that governs the galaxy with crystals and stuff.
<br />And that they have the monopoly of the crystals, or maybe I'm thinking too much, hehe," replied Ana.
<br />Ana and Lindsay were surprised by that, the planet of Tetracovix, all the things it told to them, the discovery of the name of their planet, Earth (Crystal Version), the Crystal Empire.
<br />They found that very weird, and it was weird to look at all the planets that existed in the galaxy that they were.
<br />Ana and Lindsay thought that only their planet existed, not other planets.
<br />The spaceship did not have enough fuel to use the speed boost device.
<br />Ana thought that the planet that was at war, the planet of Tetracovix, was too dangerous to go right now, they could see explosions of spaceships there.
<br />The spaceship was facing the planet of Tetracovix, the planet of Ana and Lindsay was behind the spaceship.
<br />Ana noticed that the spaceship only had space for two people, so Tetracovix could not go with them on it.
<br />After looking at the planet, Ana turned the spaceship a little to the right and pushed the accelerator, flying to a planet that looked safe to land on.
<br />"Hey sister, what do you think about the planet called Gears of the Korvax?" asked Lindsay, looking at the planet that Ana was going to.
<br />"I think it is dangerous to go there right now.
<br />But it probably was a good place to live in before that race invaded them and started a war," replied Ana.
<br />"Yeah... I agree," said Lindsay, a little sad.
<br />"But we gonna make it okay? Don't worry, it looks like they are stopping, the explosions are becoming rarer.
<br />I just gotta stop at this planet to get some Uranium to refuel the spaceship's devices, Tetracovix said that it would be out of fuel," said Ana.
<br />"Okay sis, can I drive when we go out of the planet?" asked Lindsay.
<br />"Yes, you can sis," said Ana, pushing the accelerator of the spaceship.
